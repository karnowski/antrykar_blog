      <tr> 

        <td><div align="justify">Getting across unseen would be difficult. There 

            were a hundred yards of moon-lit grassland separating one wall of 

            trees from the other, and the elves had keen night vision. It had 

            been several thousand years since the Stalker last encountered a member 

            of the vile race, but that was one detail it would never forget. 

            <p>Slipping in silence through the thicket, the Stalker scanned the 

              clearing for something&#8212;anything&#8212;that could give it access 

              to the grove. Its search was not in vain. A sliver of darkness reached 

              across the pale grass, forming an inch&#8217;s width of space through 

              which to move. The Stalker stretched along the shadow bridge, across 

              the border of the grove.</p>

            <p>Blue, ethereal torches flickered throughout the many giant tree 

              trunks, but they could not drive away all of the darkness. The Stalker 

              crept through the shadows cast by the magical flames, evading the 

              elven sentries. Though much of the massive trunks were darkened, 

              it took far longer than expected for the Stalker to find one sufficiently 

              draped in shadow. It dug its claws into the sappy bark and began 

              to climb, pulling itself toward the flickering lights high up in 

              the trees.</p>

            <p>It was not long before the Stalker came to a bridge that seemed 

              to have grown straight out of the side of the tree it was attached 

              to. The delicate scaffold connected to the next closest of the massive 

              trunks, and was one of countless walkways running throughout the 

              grove. Doors and windows lined the tree trunks, and staircases wound 

              upwards to another level of walkways. The Stalker climbed until 

              it reached the very tops of the trees. There had been twelve different 

              levels, all of them teeming with elves.</p>

            <p>Slinking inwards, the Stalker clung to the bottoms of the walkways, 

              always keeping to the deepest pockets of shadow available. The beacon 

              that had been calling to it for months was strong here, on the twelfth 

              level. Astaldereg was somewhere close. The Stalker looked forward 

              to becoming reacquainted with the only prisoner to have ever escaped 

              its grasp.</p>

            <p>The shadow leapt from walkway to walkway, moving ever closer to 

              the source of the drone in its head as it slipped past elven sentries. 

              The sound led to one of four grand, elliptical balconies that hung 

              out from the side of the center tree, overlooking the city. More 

              blue torches outlined the balconies, vesting them in a surreal glow. 

              The Stalker saw figures moving along the edge of the closest balcony, 

              and the drone in its head shifted in pitch, becoming a terrible 

              whine.</p>

            <p>The balconies were above even the highest of levels; it looked 

              as though there was no way to get there without entering the trunk 

              of the massive center tree. So the Stalker climbed up the side of 

              the trunk and slipped along the bottom of the balcony, clinging 

              to the darkness like a ladder. As it crept closer to the edge of 

              the balcony, it could hear voices.</p>

            <p>&#8220;&#8230;Hate to leave so soon.&#8221;</p>

            <p>It was a male voice, and by the way the drone was behaving, the 

              Stalker was positive it was Astaldereg.</p>

            <p>&#8220;I know. I have only just returned, and already we are planning 

              to leave. I wish there was more time, but we have to act while we 

              still can.&#8221;</p>

            <p>This second voice was female, and carried the accent of the Elves. 

              As it crept to the edge of the balcony, the Stalker was glad it 

              would get a chance to kill one of them as well.</p>

            <p>&#8220;No, I understand.&#8221; Astaldereg sighed. &#8220;He was 

              very clear in his message. We have to act now, or risk losing his 

              aid.&#8221;</p>

            <p>The Stalker stopped. The conversation was beginning to sound interesting, 

              and it thought the Master might like to know what was being said. 

              The Stalker opened a channel in its mind, sending everything it 

              sensed to its master. Once it was certain the connection was established, 

              it crept to the edge of the balcony.</p>

            <p>The Stalker had missed some of the conversation while contacting 

              its master. Astaldereg was already responding when it reached the 

              edge of the balcony.</p>

            <p>&#8220;Look, I still don&#8217;t have a real good idea what&#8217;s 

              going on here, but I&#8217;m putting my faith in you and your father 

              on this. Things have happened that I never would have expected, 

              and if you believe we can help the rest of the human race and defeat 

              this&#8230;Shadow King, then I&#8217;m all for it. I say we should&#8230;&#8221;</p>

            <p>Astaldereg broke off. The shadow heard footsteps approaching the 

              place where its prey stood. A male voice spoke in the language of 

              the Elves, causing the Stalker to cringe.</p>

            <p>Suddenly, the bottom of the balcony was flooded with blinding light. 

              Dazed, and with no darkness to cling to, the Stalker fell. It cut 

              through the air like a stone before crashing into one of the lower 

              walkways.</p>

            <p>It regained its footing, fighting disorientation as dozens of elves 

              surrounded it. They were dressed in dark blues and greens and poked 

              at it with blades and spears.</p>

            <p>Several arrows tore through the air, burying themselves in the 

              Stalker&#8217;s chest. It screamed, its voice a high-pitched, deafening 

              wail, and lunged toward the closest of the offending elves. Its 

              claw-like fingers dug into the elf&#8217;s chest, splattering blood 

              across the walkway. More arrows flew into its back, and the Stalker 

              ripped the elf&#8217;s head from its body before hurling both at 

              the archers.</p>

            <p>The elves edged closer, boxing the Stalker in. It spun, pushing 

              their spears away, forcing many from their owners&#8217; hands. 

              One of the elves swung with its sword. The Stalker tried to block, 

              but the blade slipped under its arm and into its side. Howling with 

              pain, the Stalker seized the elf by its arm and neck. It pulled, 

              ripping the limb off.</p>

            <p>The sword still sticking out of its side, the shadow turned and 

              advanced on another of the filthy elves. A third volley of arrows 

              struck, but there was already so much pain the Stalker barely noticed.</p>

            <p>In its rage, the Stalker tore through the ranks of elves, tossing 

              them aside like dolls. It was about to break through the last of 

              the group when a sparkle of silver caught its attention. It turned 

              toward the source in time to catch a silver crossbow bolt through 

              the head. It stumbled for a second, released the most pain-filled 

              wail yet, and toppled over the edge of the walkway.</p>

            <p>As it struck the ground, the silver bolt was forced deeper into 

              its head. It was dead before it stopped moving.</p>

            <p>On the other side of the world, a man sat in a room devoid of light. 

              He sat upon a throne with a grim look etched upon his face. His 

              hands gripped the edges of his throne for a moment before waving 

              his hand in the air.</p>

            <p>A door opened out of the surrounding void, and light spilled across 

              the nothingness. A servant stepped into the doorway, its features 

              blacked out by the light behind it. &#8220;Y-yes, milord?&#8221;</p>

            <p>&#8220;Bring me Jamis.&#8221;</p>

            <p>The servant bowed and hurried out of the room. As the door closed, 

              leaving him once again devoid of light, the Shadow King smiled.</p>
