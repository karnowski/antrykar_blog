<h3 class="title">Too much news... Too little title...</h3>

<p>I have two pretty major (to me, anyway) bits of news. I shall keep the most important for last, though.</p>

<p>The first is about my novel, <u>Forgotten Prophecies</u>. I have been anxiously waiting to hear from the art department at my publisher <a href="http://www.publishamerica.com">(Publish America)</a> to find out if they were going to use the cover my friend Mark Trotter did. I was relieved to find out that they accepted it, which is good because I couldn't imagine anyone being able to do a better job than he did. Anyway, here's the cover:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.anthonyrkarnowski.com/journal/archives/images/ForgottenProphecies_author.pdf">Download file</a></p>

<p>Also, a little more importantly, I found out that the official release date for the book is 9/6/04. Although, I should have my author copies before then.</p>

<p>God, I can't wait!!!</p>

<p>The book will be available for preorder sometime in the next few weeks at the <a href="http://www.publishamerica.com">Publish America</a> website. It will also be available at Amazon.com and Barnes and Noble, though it may be a few weeks after the release date before it actually shows up on their sites. It can also be ordered from any bookstore, though they won't stock it till they see a demand.</p>

<p>Anyway, on to the truly <b>important</b> news.</p>

<p>After a very long discussion yesterday, Leslie and I have decided to get married. It will be a <b>very</b> small event. We'll probably end up at the courthouse, though it's looking like my good friend Andrew Spence will be performing the ceremony. Apparently all one has to do in order to perform such ceremonies is to fill out a form online and you're ordained. I should know, I did it about two years ago.</p>

<p>That's right, I'm available for all your wedding and funeral needs.</p>

<p>Anyway, we're going to have a gathering at the Polish Ponderosa sometime following the ceremony. I don't have a lot of details right now, but as I get more I'll be sure to let everyone know.</p>

<p>Well, that about sums it up for now.</p>

<h3 class="title"><u>Dark Tower VI: Song of Susannah</u> by <a href="http://www.stephenking.com">Stephen King,</a></h3>

<p>I first discovered Stephen King's <u>Dark Tower</u> series when I was in middle school (I can't remember which grade specifically, but I know it was after I started sixth but before I finished eighth) with <u>The Gunslinger</u>. Even now I can't say what exactly it was about the series that gripped me so tightly. There is just something about the main chracter, Roland Deschain of Gilead (referred to frequently as "Old long, tall, and ugly), that speaks of more than just a character in a book. While the whole cast of characters possess a sense of reality that is rare in most novels (most of King's other titles included), there is something about Roland that makes you feel like you've known him your whole life. I'm not sure if it's because he's some sort of all-encompassing archetypal hero, or if it's just that there is so much <i>depth</i> to the character. I have never experienced another protagonist that makes you change your opinion of him so often.</p>

<p>Of course, most of the “Do I like him or hate him?” questioning happened in the first couple of books, but every now and then you have to wonder if the last of the line of the Eld really has the best interests of his ka-tet (Ka is a word used to mean, although it is not limited to just this definition, destiny. A ka-tet is a group that work together to achieve ka’s goals) in mind.</p>

<p>This, the sixth book in the series, continues the story line beautifully. I never know what to expect when I pick up a new <u>Dark Tower</u> book, but in the end it’s never anything like I thought it would be. Many plot-lines that felt unfinished at the end of the last book were tied off, but, like any series-book worth its salt, it raised almost as many questions as it answered. </p>

<p>There were a few things that happened that struck me as odd, story-wise that is, the most prominent being the introduction of a new character. I don’t want to give anything away, but if you read the novel you’ll know exactly who I’m talking about. I had some prior knowledge that it was going to happen, but it still took me a little off guard anyway. I remember thinking to myself that, because of this certain character’s inclusion, King is either brilliant or the most pretentious author in the world. I have to admit, though, I’m leaning toward the former.</p>

<p>I only have two gripes with this novel. The first is the length. At 411 pages, it left me feeling a little like a kid that tears open the package of his latest G.I. Joe action figure to find out that Hasbro left out not only the weapons, but the guy’s legs, too. If there is indeed only one more book left in the series (which I don’t doubt) that thing better be at least 650 pages. Preferably a thousand. I feel like he’s going to need at least that many to end this with anything remotely resembling finality. But that’s just me. </p>

<p>The second problem I have is with the ending. It was almost as bad as the ending of <u>The Waste Lands</u>, the third novel in the series. Maybe even worse. Don’t get me wrong, I enjoy a good cliffhanger as much as the next guy, but this just left me feeling robbed. I turned the last page and thought to myself: “That bastard… How could he end it like <I>that</I>? Now I have to wait three months to find out what happens.</p>

<p>Damn you Stephen King, you and your awe-inspiring books.</p>

<p>But, back to reality, I can not recommend this book enough. Though, if you haven’t read the first five you need to hold off. I don’t think it would make as much sense or mean as much to someone that started with this one. That would be like starting the <u>Lord of the Rings</u> half-way through <u>The Two Towers</u>; it might still be good, but you’d have no clue what the hell was happening or why you’re supposed to care about any of the characters.</p>

<p>So let me say this: Even if you aren’t a fan of Stephen King (which I would actually not list myself as one) you really need to read these books. They are some of the best stories I’ve ever read, and the world(s) involved are so real you feel like you actually live there for the time it takes to read them.<br />

<h3 class="title">Tests</h3>

<p>So I just finished taking my first Math test in at least seven years. I'm not real sure how I did. I feel pretty good about it, except for the very last question, which I had no clue how to solve. Luckily, it was the only multiple choice question on the test, so I guessed. Maybe I got it right, who knows?</p>

<p>All I really care about in this class is passing. Since I didn't do as well on the math portion of my ACT as I could have, I'm having to take this developmental course which doesn't affect my GPA. So, as long as I pass the thing I'll be happy.</p>

<p>I got back my first test in my OST class last night. (You know, the incredibly boring Word, Powerpoint, and Excel class.) Not surprisingly (not to seem arrogant) I got 100%. So, my combined average (including tests and homework) so far is a 100. Not too bad. Although, as easy as this class is, if I got anything less I would have been really angry with myself.</p>

<p>Anyway, that's all I have for now. Hope everything is well with everyone out there in the world. </p>

<h3 class="title">School and Dambrath</h3>

<p>Sorry it's been so long since I've posted anything. I started back to school last week and have been a bit busy with homework and stuff. It's been a long time since I took a class, and I almost forgot what it was like. I'm taking a general math course (which is the equivalent of high school algebra II, and damn it's fun... kidding, of course), and a class on Word, Powerpoint, and Excel. The latter class is nearly unbearable in its tediousness. But, I'm looking at it as an easy A.</p>

<p>So when I haven't been at work, school, or doing something constructive (like writing or homework), I've started playing <i>Neverwinter Nights</i> again. I have never played a better game. It's been over two years since I started playing, and it still kicks my ass. Of course, this time around it's a multiplayer Persistent World (PW) that's doing the ass-kicking. My brother, <a href="http://www.hickorywind.org">Larry</a>, told me about the world the other day. It's called <a href="http://www.dambrath.com">Dambrath</a> and is about the best PW I've come across. Most are too "Everquest" in nature (meaning you have to play almost constantly in order to have any real fun, and most of the people are "power-gaming" which gets annoying), but this one is the perfect (well, pretty near, anyway) mix of role-playing and action. If you're an RPGer, especially a NWNer, you need to check it out. </p>

<h3 class="title">All We Have is Now</h3>

<p>As logic stands, you couldn't meet a man<br />
Who's from the future<br />
But logic broke; as he appeared he spoke<br />
About the Future</p>

<p>"We're not gonna make it..."<br />
He explained how the end will come<br />
You and me were never meant to be<br />
Part of the future</p>

<p>All we have is now<br />
All we've ever had was now<br />
All we have is now<br />
All we'll ever have is now</p>

<p>I noticed that he had a watch and hat<br />
That looked familiar<br />
He was me, from a dimension torn free<br />
Of the future</p>

<p>"We're not gonna make it..."<br />
He explained how the end will come<br />
You and me were never meant to be<br />
Part of the future</p>

<p>All we have is now<br />
All we've ever had was now<br />
All we have is now<br />
All we'll ever have is now</p>

<p>All we have is now</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sing365.com/music/Lyric.nsf/All-We-Have-Is-Now-lyrics-The-Flaming-Lips/90AAECA52226CA1148256C14001E01E3">Source of the lyrics.</a></p>

<p>This is the second to last track on the album <b>Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots</b> by the <i>Flaming Lips</i>. I have listened to several of their records, and this is the only one that kicks my ass from beginning to end. It's one of those wonderful and rare albums that gets better with each listen.</p>

<p>There are a lot of people that have trouble getting past the guy's voice. It's a little high-pitched and almost whiney at times, but--I promise you--if you can acquire the taste for it, this album will quickly climb the ranks on your list of favorites.</p>

<p>It's a perfect Summertime album, even if it is a little depressing at times. The basic story of the album (though, to my knowledge, it is not a full-blown concept album. Some of the songs seem to fit nicely into the overall scheme, but some are a bit out of place as far as lyrics are concerned) is that evil, sentient machines begin to take over the world, and only Yoshimi can defeat them. Here are the lyrics for <i>Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots part 1</i>:</p>

<p>Her name is Yoshimi<br />
She's a black belt in karate<br />
Working for the city<br />
She has to discipline her body</p>

<p>Cause she knows that it's demanding to defeat those evil machines<br />
I know she can beat them</p>

<p>Oh Yoshimi<br />
They don't believe me<br />
But you won't let those<br />
Robots defeat me<br />
Oh Yoshimi<br />
They don't believe me<br />
But you won't let those<br />
Robots eat me</p>

<p>Those evil natured robots<br />
They're programmed to destroy us<br />
She's gotta be strong to fight them<br />
So she's taking lots of vitamins</p>

<p>Cause she knows that it'd be tragic<br />
If those evil robots win<br />
I know she can beat them </p>

<p><a href="http://www.sing365.com/music/Lyric.nsf/Yoshimi-Battles-the-Pink-Robots-Pt-1-lyrics-The-Flaming-Lips/BFF7AB9DCC549A3D48256C14001E1DC9">Source of the lyrics.</a></p>

<p><br />
Anyway, that tells you all about her. The album is amazing. It's a great mix of electric and organic instruments, and sounds like it should be the soundtrack for a movie. Each song takes you to a different part of the overall world, and leaves you wanting to know more about what happened. I strongly recommend this album to anyone that enjoys good music.</p>
