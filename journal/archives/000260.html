<h3 class="title">Punch Up at a Wedding</h3>

<p>I don't know<br />
Why you bother<br />
Nothing's ever good enough for you</p>

<p>I was there<br />
And it wasn't like that<br />
You've come here just to start a fight</p>

<p>You had to piss on our parade<br />
You had to shred our big day<br />
You had to ruin it for all concerned<br />
In a drunken punch-up at a wedding</p>

<p>Hypocrite<br />
Opportunist<br />
Don't infect me with your poison</p>

<p>Bully in a china shop<br />
When I turn round you stay frozen to the spot</p>

<p>You pulled the snide remarks<br />
Off lamenated charts<br />
The pot will call the kettle black<br />
It's a drunken punch-up at a wedding</p>

<p>---God I love <a href="http://www.radiohead.com">Radiohead</a>. That's really all I have to say about this one...</p>

<p>Yay Tony indeed.  I really don't want to have to do a blog, but now the pressure's cranked up a notch because now I can't use the excuse "Tony doesn't have one".  Thanks, thanks alot.  Anyway, I'm glad I've got another way of keeping tabs on you, because as you may have noticed during the tenure of our friendship, we both suck at emailing.   Anyway, good luck brother, and give us an update on your book! </p>

<p>I don't mean to keep double posting on all these blogs.  It has something to do with the international dateline, or the "preview" fuction.  Both are likely culprits.</p>

<p>Is that why you never post anything at all on my blog? Or is it b/c you don't read mine? Fine!! I see how it is!!  ;-)</p>
