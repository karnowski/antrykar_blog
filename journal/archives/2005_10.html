<h3 class="title">Happy Halloween</h3>

<p>Just wanted to wish everyone a quick, yet happy, All Hallow's Eve. I, unfortunately live in a relatively trick-or-treater-free zone, so my night will mostly be filled by scary movies and a bowl of candy that I hope people will come and eat so I don't have to. Though, I don't suppose eating a few pieces here and there would hurt. I mean, it is Halloween after all, right?</p>

<p>Anyway, I hope everyone has a safe and scary-as-hell (but in the good way) day. </p>

<h3 class="title">A Pleasant Surprise</h3>

<p>After Leslie and I got back from a short walk yesterday, I was surprised to find the 30 copies of <b>Path of Darkness</b> I ordered waiting on the front porch. They showed up way quicker than I expected.</p>

<p>I went through both boxes, examining every copy, and they all look great! I can't wait to see a stack of them next to a pile of <b>Forgotten Prophecies</b>!</p>

<p>And, as luck would have it, I'm going to have a chance next Saturday at the <a href="http://www.bristolcomicfest.com">Bristol Comic Festival</a>. If you'll be at the Bristol Con, please stop by my table!</p>

<h3 class="title">Path of Darkness on Amazon and Barnes and Noble</h3>

<p><b>Path of Darkness</b> has been added to <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?userid=QO7Wd1MC9o&isbn=1591138167&itm=2">Barnes and Noble</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1591138167/qid=1130341752/sr=1-2/ref=sr_1_2/102-1703204-3355349?v=glance&s=books">Amazon.com</a>. They still don't have the cover of the book listed, and probably won't for a few weeks, but it is available for order through both sites. I still recommend you buy it straight from <a href="http://www.booklocker.com/books/2198.html">Booklocker</a>, though, as you'll get it much faster. Plus, they have the first three chapters up and free to read.</p>

<p>That's it for now...</p>

<h3 class="title">Path of Darkness Now Available!!!</h3>

<p><b>Path of Darkness</b>, the second installment of the Iluvian Cycle and sequel to <b>Forgotten Prophecies</b> is now available for order!!! It's not listed on Amazon or Barnes and Noble yet, but it will be very soon. In the meantime, you can order print or ebook copies by <a href="http://www.booklocker.com/books/2198.html">clicking here</a>. In fact I would encourage everyone to order their copies from <a href="http://www.booklocker.com/books/2198.html">Booklocker</a> anyway, as you'll get it much faster and probably pay a little less shipping.</p>

<p>I'm so excited I can hardly contain myself!!!</p>

<h3 class="title">Path of Darkness Update</h3>

<p>The proof copy of <b>Path of Darkness</b> arrived today, and it looks fantastic! After looking it over and making sure everything looked all right, I let the good people at <a href="http://www.booklocker.com">Booklocker</a> know. As soon as they get it listed and ready for sale, I'll post another update. It looks like it shouldn't be much longer than another week or so...</p>

<p>Here's hoping...</p>

<p>The second is a book signing at Hastings in Maryville on November 25 from 4:00 pm till 8:00 pm.</p>

<p>I still don't have a definitive date on <b>Path of Darkness</b>, but I'll post it as soon as I do.</p>

<p>Right. That's all I've got for now...</p>

<h3 class="title">Revoluticon and Serenity</h3>

<p>This past Saturday was spent in Asheville at Revoluticon. It was a very small and very young con, but I had a great time. My reading was the most successful I've had yet, even though I was so nervous I could barely look up from the podium. I'm hoping I'll get better at these presentations as I do more. Thanks to everyone that attended, asked questions, and bought a book afterwards!</p>

<p>On a different note, Leslie and I finally went to see Serenity yesterday afternoon. I've been dying to see it, but due to our schedules and having to be out of town, I had to wait. It was worth it. Fans of the short-lived Firefly tv show will not be disappointed, and any newcomers should be able to fall right in with the story line. This is sci-fi as it should be. The focus of the film was were it should be: on the characters and the story. While the special effects were out-standing, you could tell that Joss Whedon views them as he should: as a tool withwhich to tell a story. Unlike some sci-fi movies these days (Star Wars, anyone?), the story wasn't there to support the special effects. The action sequences were well done and not too over the top. All in all, it was a really great flick. </p>

<h3 class="title">Hybrids and Homework</h3>

<p>While taking a short break from doing homework, I came across <a href="http://alternet.org/envirohealth/25972/">this article</a> on <a href="http://www.alternet.org">alternet</a>.</p>

<p>There are some very good points made about hybrid technology and the future of cars in general. In the realm of environmental concerns - something we should all be more involved in - hybrid technology probably <i>won't</i> make a huge difference in our very near future. But by having the kinks already worked out when alternative fuel sources like hydrogen and ethanol become commonplace, we're helping to increase fuel efficiency in all cars from now on.</p>

<p>Anyway, back to Biology...</p>
