<h3 class="title">Blount Today Article</h3>

<p>So, the article that came about as a result of the interview I did last week is now out and available to be read. I think the hard-copy magazine will be available tomorrow, though you can read it now by clicking <a href="http://www.blounttoday.com/blnt/home/article/0,2355,BLNT_18867_3153373,00.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>I noticed a few typos, and I'm a little disappointed that she called me Tony instead of Anthony, but that's just me being nit-picky. Overall I think she did a great job, and I'm very thankful for the press. There was one part where I'm afraid I might come off as a bit bitchy, but I guess that's fair, as I <b>am</b> a bit bitchy.</p>

<p>Anyway, there should be a review of the book and another interview in UTK's student paper, <a href="http://dailybeacon.utk.edu/">The Daily Beacon</a>, sometime this week. I'm pretty sure it, too, will be posted on the website, so I'll be sure to link to it from here when it's available.</p>

<p><b>--UPDATE--</b></p>

<p>I just stopped by <a href="http://www.blounttoday.com">Blount Today's Website</a> again, and they've got a picture of me up there along with the cover of the novel. I'm sorry to say it, but the picture took me a little off guard. It even scared me a little bit. I look more like a zombie in that pic than I did in Wes's zombie movie, Dead End...</p>

<p>Oh well...</p>

<p>I'm not really sure what happened with the eyes. Could have been the brown background messing with the lighting, although I really haven't the slightest clue about anything having to do (even remotely) with photography.</p>

<p>But all in all I think it was a pretty good article, too.</p>

<p>That is kinda a wonky pic of you, babe. You look much different in my last memories of seeing you... cripes, three years go this christmas. That's WAY too darned long.</p>

<p>Anyway... I'm off to enjoy living in my own place for the first time in 11 months. (Well, mine & Niy's.) And we have our own DSL now, yay!</p>

<p>Going to go futz around in the kitchen.</p>

<p>Love,<br />
