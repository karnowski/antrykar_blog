<h3 class="title">Santa's Beard by They Might Be Giants</h3>

<p>Once a year my friend puts on a red suit<br />
And hangs around with me and my wife<br />
Now I can't help but feeling jealous each time she climbs on his knee<br />
And she stands beneath the mistletoe screaming<br />
For him to stand beneath the mistletoe screaming<br />
Now I can't help but feeling jealous each time she climbs on his knee<br />
Why must she climb on his knee?</p>

<p>I saw my baby wearing Santa's beard<br />
She kissed him once and whispered in his ear<br />
I saw my baby wearing Santa's beard<br />
I wish he would go<br />
He's breaking up my home</p>

<p>She always had this twisted side to her<br />
But she'd never drag my name around town<br />
But lately she's been humming cheating songs<br />
And I don't like that fat guy around<br />
No, I don't like that fat guy around</p>

<p>I saw my baby wearing Santa's beard<br />
She kissed him once and whispered in his ear<br />
I saw my baby wearing Santa's beard<br />
I wish he would go<br />
He's breaking up my home</p>

<p>I saw my baby wearing Santa's beard<br />
Thrilling Christmas, trembling fear<br />
I saw my baby wearing Santa's beard<br />
I wish he would go<br />
He's breaking up my home</p>

<p>While not necessarily a "Christmas Song," it's still one of my favorites from the season. Mainly because its the Giants, who I contend to be one of, if not <b>the</b> greatest band of all time. It's a really catchy tune--just like every other song they've ever written--and just thinking about it makes my head bob.</p>

<p>Oh well, I'm a geek, I know.</p>

<p>In case I don't post again, I hope everyone has a happy holiday season, regardless of their personal beliefs. Though, I have to say this, I was thinking yesterday about how strange it is that we live in a Nation that claims to possess religious freedom, but everywhere you look this time of year there is something to do with Christmas. While I don't know that it is enfringing on anyone's personal beliefs and being basically Christian myself I don't personally have a problem with this, but I wonder what it's like to grow up Muslim or Jewish or Buddhist or really any other religion in the US. Does it offend them that you can't escape Christmas at all from Thanksgiving (actually, it seems more like Halloween, now) on?</p>

<p>Of course, all of this is kind of pointless. As we all know, Christmas is no longer about celebrating Jesus or anything remotely religious. All it is now is a capitalist holiday designed to keep retailers in the black. Don't get me wrong, I know our economy needs something like this to survive (though I don't really understand why), but I just wish everyone could be a little more honest about it. That's a problem I run into at work, too. I wouldn't care so much that we're getting screwed on a regular basis, as long as they had the decency to tell us to our face instead of hiding behind a bunch of silly propoganda that any twelve year old with half a brain can see through...</p>

<p>Sorry. I'm not sure where that came from.</p>

<p>Anyway, before I spoil anyone's holiday high, I hope everyone has a safe and fun holiday. Spend time with your friends and family, eat lots of stuff that's bad for you, and enjoy what the season is supposed to represent: community.<br />
