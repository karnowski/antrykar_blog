<h3 class="title">A New Entry at Scifan.com</h3>

<p>I was looking at <a href="http://www.scifan.com">Scifan.com</a> (sort of an IMDB or Allmusic.com for SF&F authors, novels and the like) a minute ago and realized that I've been added to the database! For some reason it says that the book isn't actually available for order until early September (I think it may have something to do with the information released originally by the publisher) but they already have a link to the Amazon and Alibris pages that list it for sale. You can look at it <a href="http://www.scifan.com/writers/kk/KarnowskiRAnthony.asp">here</a>.</p>

<p>To quote <u>The Jerk</u>, "it's this kind of random publicity that can really get your name out."</p>

<p>Anyway, I was excited, so I thought I would share.</p>

<p>Also, the <b>Characters</b> page has been updated with a pic and brief description of Elyas. I'm hoping to expand the descriptions at a later date, but Mark did a great job on the background and the coloring. Check it out!</p>

<p>A) you know my e-mail address, so I'm not risking the spambots stealing it, and have entered a fake one.</p>

<p>B) I fucked up my ankle royally by twisting the hell out of it last friday, and am on crutches and in a splint. I tripped off a 6" step that I walk up and down 5 times a day every day I'm at work. You'd've laughed your arse off, boy. :)</p>

<p>C) I have SIX Gmail invites. Would you like one?</p>

<p>Love,<br />
Bryn</p>

<p>A) Fair enough.</p>

<p>B) That sucks, man. I hope you start feelin better soon. Was it just a spastic day or were there forces working against you?</p>

<p>C) I might, if I knew what that was...</p>

<p>It's always good to hear from you, Bryn. Even better to have you visiting my site. :)</p>

<p>B) Neither. I wasn't having a spastic day, nor were there forces aligning against me... it was just dumb luck and bad timing. Hurts like the dickens, though, and not just my ankle: my pride's a bit bruised as well. I detest being a gimp.</p>

<p>C) Gmail is to Google as Hotmail is to Microsquish. Gmail is a web-based mail client that gives you 1 Gig of free storage space. I've been using it for a couple months and it's pretty damn cool. So if you'd like an e-mail address, let me know and I'll invite you (right now signup is by invitation only) and if not, I'll give it to someone else or sell it on Ebay. (Yes, you can do that; they go for right around a dollar apiece. Also, many people will barter very interesting things for them. They are rather like currency.)</p>

<p>Heh. Nice to see you have a site. Course I'd never have found it if I didn't have a habit of googling my friends now and then to see what they are up to. You never told me about the site. :) Silly.</p>

<p>Hugs,<br />

<p>Right on. I'll definitely take a gmail invite, if the offer still stands. Thanks a bunch!</p>

<p>Are you sure I didn't tell you about this before?</p>

<p>Of course, it would be like me... I don't have the greatest memory in the world...</p>
