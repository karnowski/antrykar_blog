<h3 class="title">Post Election Blues</h3>

<p>So, it's finally set in that we have four more years of Bush and his "mandate" ahead of us. Four more years of eroding civil rights, and four more years of waking up every morning to ask myself "Who are we going to go to war with next?" But now, I think I have the added bonus of waking up to wonder when the draft is going back in effect and I have to worry about whether I'll be called to go fight and die for some oil tycoon's increased profit margin.</p>

<p>If I'm coming across like I'm bitching, I'm sorry. It's just really got me down.</p>

<p>There are times when I wish our nation would reclaim our pre-WWII stance of neutrality. There's a lot to be said for minding your own business and keeping your beak out of where it doesn't belong.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, at the same time I'm wishing that we would leave the rest of the world alone, I find myself wanting to leave this place and try out a new government. But where to go? And would it even be worth it? I know I should stay here and try to make things better, but there comes a time when you have to cut your losses and move on to something else. Is the US so hopelessly lost that we have to do that?</p>

<p>I love this country. I love the fact that I am free to do whatever I want (within reason). I love the fact that I'm free to write what I want and do whatever I want with those writings. But I have to say I'm really scared about the future, and it's got me bummed out.</p>

<p>Oh well, enough of the whining...</p>

<p>In good news, I've got a little over 140,000 words on the sequel to <i>Forgotten Prophecies</i>. I think I may have the first draft done within the next couple of weeks. The ending has changed, dramatically, and so, too, has the tentative title. It looks like the <b>next</b> book, the third in the series, will be titled <i>The Crystal Skull</i>, and this one is going to probably be called <i>Passage of Darkness</i>. Or, at least, something like that. I'll keep you updated when I figure it out for sure.</p>

<p>The manuscript is at almost 450 pages, and I project it will take at least another 50 or so to finish it out, though I thought that when I was at about 300 pages, too.</p>

<p>Anyway. Thank you all for letting me rant and whine for a minute. I'll do my best to keep these sorts of things from happening too often.</p>

<p>In the meantime, feel free to <a href="mailto:ark@anthonyrkarnowski.com"> email me</a> with thoughts, comments, or just to say hi.</p>
