<h3 class="title">Technology has a tendency to make me really angry</h3>

<p>Take my iPod, for example. Most of the time it's a wonderful little gadget that makes listening to music very easy and enjoyable. Except for today. While trying to update a few existing playlists and adding several new ones, it somehow managed to erase EVERYTHING and now I'm left with a very expensive paperweight. Not to mention the fact since I'm running Windows, the battery life is drained in a matter of seconds so that actually putting anything on it is like a timed trial. I'm still trying to figure out how it erased everything. Or, more over, why. I had it set to update manually, so it shouldn't have tried to update on its own.</p>

<p>Grrr.</p>

<p>Sometimes I wonder why I even bother with this stuff. It seems like most gadgets that are supposed to make life easier never live up to the hype. All I get are more headaches and less time to do the things I would actually like to do. Like listen to music.</p>

<p>Oh well. I just had to vent for a second.</p>

<p>Wait a minute. You have a Mac laptop and you update your iPod from Windows?</p>

<p>That must be an old damn laptop.</p>

<p>I know exactly how you feel mate. Just about every piece of technology I touch has broken in one form or another. <br />
Maybe we have SUPER POWERS!! </p>

<p>yeah thats it....</p>

<p>Bryn! I haven't heard from you in forever! How's things?</p>

<p>Actually, the mac laptop ended up going to Leslie. She does a lot of photoshoping, so it made sense for her to keep the mac. Basically all I do is write, surf the net, and play games on my laptop, so I've stayed with a PC for now. The next laptop I buy, however, will be a Mac. At least, I think so...</p>

<p>You know, Cameron, I thought for a very long time that the reason I had such a horrible time with electronics was because I was blessed with some sort of anti-technology gene that zapped any and all gadgets I came into contact with. This was, in part, why I thought playing the drums would be better than the bass or something that requires amplification. I was always afraid I'd blow the stuff up. How nice it would be if that were true...</p>

<p>In reality, though, I think it's just that most companies now make their products with expiration dates. That way you have to keep buying the same things over and over again. I mean, who wants a DVD player that lasts forever? I don't know about you, but I love having to shell out $100 every few years to buy a new one.</p>

<p>I remember the first VCR my parents bought. It was one of the first ones made, and that frigging thing lasted forever. We finally retired it after close to 20 years of use. Granted, it would no longer rewind tapes, but it still played them. I'm already on my third DVD player. They just keep crapping out. I don't buy the cheapest of the cheap, either. It's just too bad no one makes anything to last anymore...</p>

<p>                    Hear! Hear!</p>

<p>     My iPod Shuffle is now just one more thing I have to pick up off the floor when I clean my room.  The songs and podcasts I had on it stopped deleting one day, which would have been tolerable, if the songs that were stuck on there would gosh darn play. F#&#$%$##$#@%$%&*%$$!!!!!</p>

<p>     So, yes, I empathize.</p>

<p>Well, I somehow managed to get the iPod working again, for which I'm very glad, but now my technology issues have turned to wireless networking. It seems as soon as I get it to work, something else goes wrong with it.</p>

<p>Sometimes I feel like breaking things. Like computers. But that would be expensive, and I need them for things like work.</p>

<p>Oh well. Life is just one problem after another. So be it.</p>

<p>Heh, funny you should ask - I'm two surgeries and one lithotripsy older and approximately 18 ounces of kidney stone lighter than I was the last time I talked to you. I did send you an e-mail once but judging by your warm response you didn't actually get it. (I thought not when you didn't reply.)</p>

<p>Also, I am now using PCs exclusively -- if I'm going to have to use a damn X86 processor, I might as well get the benefits of software giants. I have a pos quicksilver g4 desktop sitting around... you want it? </p>

<p>Anyway. I'm assuming as the moderator/owner of the comments file you can see my e-mail address. If not, it's my old net-pop username at gmail dot com. Feel free to drop me a line sometime -- I need to give you my new phone numbers anyway.</p>

<p>Congrats on getting the 2nd novel published, btw.</p>

<p>You know, really, that wouldn't be a horrible thing at all.</p>

<p>I'm starting to think, though, that I should just kill the forum... It doesn't seem like anyone really uses it...</p>

<p>I put it up originally so anyone could post something, as opposed to the blog where I start the post and other people comment on it... I don't know, I'm jsut thinking out loud (on screen... whatever) at this point.</p>

<p>It should be working. I check it at least once a day. It goes down sometimes, but it's usually up when I go...</p>

<p>Weird...</p>

<p>When was the last time you checked it?</p>
