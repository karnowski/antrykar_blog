<p>Not too much to report today. I've made a bit more progress on the first book of the Myths of Thera, but otherwise all is quiet on the writing front. I've spent the morning continuing my reread of the Harry Potter series (I started on Goblet this morning). Soon I will be heading out to teach some people how to play the drums. I never really saw myself teaching, but at about a year and a half in I'm still digging it immensely.</p>

<p>Anyway, I'll write again if/when I have something else to talk about. This entry was mainly an attempt to keep myself blogging. It's been a while since I've done it consistently, and I really need to get back into the habit.</p>

<p>Until next time...</p>

<p>Cheating Spoon played last night at Vinnie T's Clubhouse in Cookville, TN. I had never played Cookville before and wasn't sure what to expect. It turned out to be a really great gig. The staff were nice and we had a pretty good turnout. The music was great. I think since it's been a month since our last gig we had a lot to say last night.</p>

<p>I just finished up an article for Blount Today and sent it off to the editor. I think it should be out in this Thursday's issue. I've been writing about an article a month for the last three or four months. It's very low-stress, but I could handle doing a few more. An article a week would be awesome, really.</p>

<p>Right now I'm just hanging around before Ron gets here so we can finally start going over the material for the next Citizen X album. We have to put a few finishing touches on a couple of tunes, but the album should hopefully be fairly easy to finish. We'll just have to see.</p>

<p>Right. Now I'm off to get something to eat...</p>

<h3 class="title">So, Where Have I Been?</h3>

<p>I could just say "away" and be done with it, but I don't think I'll do that. There's a lot to talk about since the last time I posted, and I'm not even counting that last "Wow it's been a long time" thing, either.</p>

<p>To keep it as brief as possible, I've been putting quite a bit of time and energy into musical projects over the last year or so. I'm teaching drums and percussion part time at a local music shop and have been playing with several groups around Knoxville and the surrounding areas including Cheating Spoon, Leslie Woods and Dark Mountain Orchid, and occasional gigs with the Doug Harris Project. I've still been working with Ron in Citizen X, though we haven't been as productive as normal. This is largely due to the fact that Leslie and I moved into a new house in West Knoxville. It took a while for us to get things situated, and since then the days have been more and more hectic.</p>

<p>I've had a few fits of trying to get back into writing, but my time and energy levels have been so drained that I haven't really been able to put much into other than the occasional article for Blount Today. I've started reworking The Sacred Magicks of Elrinm the Mage, which I am now calling simply: Myths of Thera - Book I. Who knows if I'll keep that title or not, but it's as good as any at this point. I've got a decent start on it, and I can feel myself getting excited about the story, which is a good sign, I think.</p>

<p>You know, only two paragraphs later and I feel pretty good about having summed up the last year. I plan on making this a regular thing again. I think I may have finally found the balance I've needed in order to follow both my musical and literary paths...</p>
