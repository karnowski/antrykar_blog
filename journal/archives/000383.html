<h3 class="title"><u>The Five People You Meet In Heaven</u> by Mitch Albom</h3>

<p><u>The Five People You Meet in Heaven</u> is not what you might think as you pick it up off the shelf. It’s not an overly religious book; it doesn’t try to shove any kind belief down your throat. No, <u>The Five People You Meet in Heaven</u> is a wonderfully written book that shares with you the author’s <i>idea</i> of what heaven might be like.</p>

<p>While the writing of the story is not would I would call deep, the meaning behind the words is. If you have ever contemplated the meaning of life—not the generic “Why did God put us here?” but the specific: “Why am <i>I</i> here? Why do <i>I</i> exist?”—then you will find the book not only entertaining but thought-provoking.</p>

<p>The story opens with its main character, a man named Eddie who has spent his life working as the head of maintenance for a boardwalk carnival, on the day he dies. Once he reaches heaven, he is met by the first of his five people (everyone has their own set of five). Without going too deeply into the story, we learn that each of the people he will meet touched his life in some way. While he may never have met them, their lives affected his in some monumental way.</p>

<p>Mr. Albom did a splendid job of weaving the tale together, jumping back and forth between Eddie’s past and his encounters in heaven. The concept that the first thing that happens when you reach heaven is learn what purpose your life served is beautiful and somehow comforting. Countless people drift through their lives, wondering everyday what their purpose is and why they were born. While the book offers no real answers, it is still uplifting and gives us a glimmer of hope that, one day, it will all be explained to us.<br />

<p>You're firmly in the pocket of Mr. Albom aren't you?  That's a pretty glowing review, but I can't say it makes me want to read it.  Go figure.  Aren't you supposed to be at the beach?  Or getting married?  Put the books down, get off the computer, and get to it sucka.  </p>

<p>I'm glad you liked the book Tony. I thought it was wonderful. Your Dad even read it. He liked it too. It's one of those books that you want to talk to people about after you finish it. I really loved it. And Kip, we leave tomorrow. Can't wait!!!!!</p>
