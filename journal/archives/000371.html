<h3 class="title">Too much news... Too little title...</h3>

<p>I have two pretty major (to me, anyway) bits of news. I shall keep the most important for last, though.</p>

<p>The first is about my novel, <u>Forgotten Prophecies</u>. I have been anxiously waiting to hear from the art department at my publisher <a href="http://www.publishamerica.com">(Publish America)</a> to find out if they were going to use the cover my friend Mark Trotter did. I was relieved to find out that they accepted it, which is good because I couldn't imagine anyone being able to do a better job than he did. Anyway, here's the cover:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.anthonyrkarnowski.com/journal/archives/images/ForgottenProphecies_author.pdf">Download file</a></p>

<p>Also, a little more importantly, I found out that the official release date for the book is 9/6/04. Although, I should have my author copies before then.</p>

<p>God, I can't wait!!!</p>

<p>The book will be available for preorder sometime in the next few weeks at the <a href="http://www.publishamerica.com">Publish America</a> website. It will also be available at Amazon.com and Barnes and Noble, though it may be a few weeks after the release date before it actually shows up on their sites. It can also be ordered from any bookstore, though they won't stock it till they see a demand.</p>

<p>Anyway, on to the truly <b>important</b> news.</p>

<p>After a very long discussion yesterday, Leslie and I have decided to get married. It will be a <b>very</b> small event. We'll probably end up at the courthouse, though it's looking like my good friend Andrew Spence will be performing the ceremony. Apparently all one has to do in order to perform such ceremonies is to fill out a form online and you're ordained. I should know, I did it about two years ago.</p>

<p>That's right, I'm available for all your wedding and funeral needs.</p>

<p>Anyway, we're going to have a gathering at the Polish Ponderosa sometime following the ceremony. I don't have a lot of details right now, but as I get more I'll be sure to let everyone know.</p>

<p>Well, that about sums it up for now.</p>

<p>Excellent choice on the release date - great things have been born into this world on Sep 6. And congratulations to you and Leslie on getting hitched!  I can vouch for the courthouse venue... although I'd wish I'd known you were ordained.  We could have flown you over, and  you'd probably be able to pronounce my name way better than that Japanese guy.  What are the chances of a language having neither a V nor an L sound?</p>

<p>Oh my god Barerie, you and Kip have to get back here. I want to spent some time with you. You crack me up!!I already knew Tony's news, both of them, and am thrilled about both. But mostly about getting a daughter in law. it's about time!!</p>

<p>Well all I can say is, ITS ABOUT TIME! (Glad to see the bouquet and garter came to good use.) I guess it took your lil sis doing stuff first to get your butt in gear :) I'm so excited for the both of you.  You know, if you didnt want to do stuffy courthouse, you could do like our cousin Molli and get married on the bridge by the courthouse at the greenbelt.  Oh yeah, I don't care how small the event is, my happy butt will be there :) <br />
Tony I'm so proud of you right now, you have no idea.  Getting married, publishing a book, owning your own house, you've really become a great man.  I'm proud of you bro. Love you and Leslie bunches!</p>

<p>What a blog!!! Thats too much good news at one time--I think my brain is spinning! I produced a fabulous work on Sept. 6 and I know you will too. I can't wait to buy my copy and have it autographed. I know your Mom is soooo excited to have a daughter in the family and Leslie gets very high reviews.  And Mom K those two in the other hemisphere do need to come home soon. We need to have a Smokey Mtn. ceremony to make it official.  What do we call you Tony?--ordained on high???</p>

<p>Ok, I'm not at work, so I can actually take the time to congratulate you two.  That's exciting news, and it's only dampened for me slightly by the fact that I won't be around to celebrate with you.  I have a 4 (yes count'em 1,2,3,4) day weekend this week, so I'll try and get you on the phone to say it personally.  I can only assume the release date was coincidental.  And by coincidental I mean "a sign of greatness".  You'll have to have a book signing event at the ponderosa whenever we get back in town.  Again, that's wonderful news you two.</p>

<p>  By the way, once you two are married won't she legally be entitled (or possibly obligated, if Frank the Truth has any say in it) to post on your blog?    </p>

<p>Hmmm, well Tony uses his ARK blog for promoting his book, but I should give Leslie a login to the Hot Tub... if I haven't already....  (goes to check)</p>

<p>Congratulations to you and Leslie!  I'm so very happy for the two of you!  Are you thinking very soon or will Seth be home in time?</p>

<div class="comments-body">
<p>Honestly, it will probably be sometime this month. And no, to any of you who might be thinking it, we don't HAVE to get married... We just figure why wait?</p>

<p>I am disappointed that we'll be doing it before the Enland boys make it back, but we can have a big party when they do return to celebrate it and Kip and Barerie's as well as Seth's return. True, it will be after the facts, but who cares? It's all about friends and family, you know?</p>
