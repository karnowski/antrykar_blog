<h3 class="title">Santa's Beard by They Might Be Giants</h3>

<p>Once a year my friend puts on a red suit<br />
And hangs around with me and my wife<br />
Now I can't help but feeling jealous each time she climbs on his knee<br />
And she stands beneath the mistletoe screaming<br />
For him to stand beneath the mistletoe screaming<br />
Now I can't help but feeling jealous each time she climbs on his knee<br />
Why must she climb on his knee?</p>

<p>I saw my baby wearing Santa's beard<br />
She kissed him once and whispered in his ear<br />
I saw my baby wearing Santa's beard<br />
I wish he would go<br />
He's breaking up my home</p>

<p>She always had this twisted side to her<br />
But she'd never drag my name around town<br />
But lately she's been humming cheating songs<br />
And I don't like that fat guy around<br />
No, I don't like that fat guy around</p>

<p>I saw my baby wearing Santa's beard<br />
She kissed him once and whispered in his ear<br />
I saw my baby wearing Santa's beard<br />
I wish he would go<br />
He's breaking up my home</p>

<p>I saw my baby wearing Santa's beard<br />
Thrilling Christmas, trembling fear<br />
I saw my baby wearing Santa's beard<br />
I wish he would go<br />
He's breaking up my home</p>

<p><a href="http://www.oldielyrics.com/lyrics/they_might_be_giants/santas_beard.html">Source of the lyrics</a>.</p>

<p>While not necessarily a "Christmas Song," it's still one of my favorites from the season. Mainly because its the Giants, who I contend to be one of, if not <b>the</b> greatest band of all time. It's a really catchy tune--just like every other song they've ever written--and just thinking about it makes my head bob.</p>

<p>Oh well, I'm a geek, I know.</p>

<p>In case I don't post again, I hope everyone has a happy holiday season, regardless of their personal beliefs. Though, I have to say this, I was thinking yesterday about how strange it is that we live in a Nation that claims to possess religious freedom, but everywhere you look this time of year there is something to do with Christmas. While I don't know that it is enfringing on anyone's personal beliefs and being basically Christian myself I don't personally have a problem with this, but I wonder what it's like to grow up Muslim or Jewish or Buddhist or really any other religion in the US. Does it offend them that you can't escape Christmas at all from Thanksgiving (actually, it seems more like Halloween, now) on?</p>

<p>Of course, all of this is kind of pointless. As we all know, Christmas is no longer about celebrating Jesus or anything remotely religious. All it is now is a capitalist holiday designed to keep retailers in the black. Don't get me wrong, I know our economy needs something like this to survive (though I don't really understand why), but I just wish everyone could be a little more honest about it. That's a problem I run into at work, too. I wouldn't care so much that we're getting screwed on a regular basis, as long as they had the decency to tell us to our face instead of hiding behind a bunch of silly propoganda that any twelve year old with half a brain can see through...</p>

<p>Sorry. I'm not sure where that came from.</p>

<p>Anyway, before I spoil anyone's holiday high, I hope everyone has a safe and fun holiday. Spend time with your friends and family, eat lots of stuff that's bad for you, and enjoy what the season is supposed to represent: community.<br />

<h3 class="title">News Sentinel Blurb</h3>

<p>Someone at work told me this morning that there was a review of <b>Forgotten Prophecies</b> in the Sunday edition of the Knoxville News Sentinel. I looked around online and found a link to <a href="http://www.knoxnews.com/kns/books/article/0,1406,KNS_306_3404332,00.html">this article</a>. It's not really a review, and you have to scroll all the way to the bottom of the page to read it, but it's better than nothing in the Sentinel at all. I had pretty much given up hope of them ever putting anything in there. For those of you that don't feel like clicking on the above link, I'll paste the whole of the "blurb" here:</p>

<p>"<i>Forgotten Prophecies by Anthony R. Karnowski ($19.95, Publish America, Baltimore, Md.) - This science-fiction adventure by Knoxville native and Alcoa resident Anthony R. Karnowski tells a of man wrongly accused of crimes. <br />
The story also includes elves, dwarves and a subterranean world thought to exist only in legends. </p>

<p>The protagonist, Kyr Astaldereg, must go into hiding in that subterranean world. There, he is drawn into an ancient war. Astaldereg and his friends are the only hope for the future as they try to fulfill a series of prophecies the human race has forgotten.</i>" - written by Amy McRary</p>

<p>Really, I get the feeling all they did was read the back cover, but, again, I'm not complaining. I'm actually very happy and thankful they put anything in at all.</p>

<p>Anyway, I just thought I'd share.</p>

<h3 class="title">Book Signing and Satan's Stapler</h3>

<p>The book signing at Hasting's last Saturday went very well. I was really relieved because I was afraid there would be no way to live up to the success of the first one. Thanks to everyone that attended! </p>

<p>Also, I have just been confirmed to appear at the <a href="http://www.secfi.org/concarolinas/index.htm">ConCarolinas in Charlotte, NC on June 3-5</a>. I'm really looking forward to it! I've got a few other conventions that I'm waiting to hear back from, but as soon as I know for sure I'll pass that info along. I'm planning on adding an "Upcoming Appearances" page on the site sometime in the near future. Keep an eye out for it.</p>

<p>And, finally, <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&category=1523&item=5542481688">a stapler possessed by either Satan or the ghost of Hitler</a> is up for bid on eBay. The whole description is hilarious, though my favorite part was "<i>At first it worked fine, but I accidentally shot a staple into my finger.  Since then, it's thirst for blood has been unquenchable.</i>"</p>

<p>Good times.</p>

<h3 class="title">When Good Dogs do Bad Things by the Dillinger Escape Plan</h3>

<p>I'm the best you'll ever have<br />
You're the best I'll never have</p>

<p>Pain...<br />
Gone.<br />
Rain...<br />
Stop.<br />
Sun...<br />
Shine.<br />
You're...<br />
Mine.</p>

<p>Here kitty kitty kitty</p>

<p>MOMMY MOMMY MOMMY MOMMY MOMMY</p>

<p>Listen:<br />
listen through the walls<br />
the sound of quick footsteps sneaking down the hall<br />
whispers<br />
the pages turning<br />
the leaky roof<br />
the toilet flushing<br />
numbers on the license plate</p>

<p>I'm nothing more than<br />
The best you'll never have<br />
A speck on your bedroom wall<br />
A blood red waterfall</p>

<p>THE BEST YOU WILL EVER HAVE</p>

<p>Your dead things are locked up inside<br />
Blow smoke rings straight back in time<br />
Roses floating out with the tide<br />
Dance and sing under gunfire<br />
Open wings slowly take flight...</p>

<p>Around these parts a fly can live---<br />
A fly can live a thousand years<br />
but a man cannot die soon enough, true enough</p>

<p>A smiling drunk nursing a glass of milk<br />
A girl with a face like prison bread<br />
Over the kitchen noise I hear them howl at me</p>

<p>A scabby ketchup bottle and a two-dollar bill<br />
I guess its time to pay the bill, but you know I never will<br />
I'm hungry still...</p>

<p>RUN AWAY RUN AWAY RUN AWAY RUN AWAY</p>

<p>Mercy killing on the way<br />
Never thought I'd hear you say<br />
Falling to your knees and pray now...</p>

<p>In this crowded place I could swing a cat<br />
And not even hit a soul...<br />
It's just the lonely vacuum of human black holes</p>

<p>And I'm as dry as these thirsty trees<br />
with big city thoughts in the dirty breeze...<br />
promising to set me free<br />
"waiter, check please..."</p>

<p>I'M THE BEST YOU WILL EVER HAVE</p>

<p><br />
<a href="http://www.letssingit.com/?http://www.letssingit.com/dillinger-escape-plan-bhw9m.html">Source of the lyrics.</a></p>

<p>This song is from the four song EP, <b>Irony is a Dead Scene</b>, they did with Mike Patton on lead vocals. While it's short, its one of the best collections of music I've come across in a while. It, combined with Tomahawk's latest album, Mit Gas, are among some of the most inspirational albums I've heard in far too long a time. It's all pretty heavy, so if you aren't in to that sort of thing, this may not be for you. I have to say though, that pretty much anything with Mike Patton associated with it is golden. The man amazes me. Not only is he probably the best and most diverse vocalist alive and working today, but his lyrics are damn good, too. Granted they're a little dark, and maybe a little homicidal at times, but they paint very vivid pictures and leave you thinking.</p>

<p>Anyway, it's kicking my ass, so I thought I would share.</p>

<h3 class="title">Early Christmas</h3>

<p>So, my brother <a href="http://www.hickorywind.org">Larry</a> gave Leslie and I his old iBook laptop, and we finally got the OS and a wireless access point for it yesterday. Now that it's finally up and running, I'm seriously contemplating selling all of my PC's and moving strictly to Macs. Of course, I'm not really serious, not yet anyway, but I firmly believe that I will never buy another PC again. I made a comment to Leslie about how switching from my own laptop (an ancient IBM Thinkpad) over to this one (which will primarily be hers) is like going from a crappy, run-down Ford to a Mercedes or BMW.</p>

<p>Macs just make sense. The organization is very easy to pick up on, and everything looks so much better. I mean EVERYTHING. I went to ebay for a minute, and even it looked nicer. Maybe I'm just romanticizing it, but I'm totally sold on Apple now.</p>

<p>Plus, I finally got a wireless card for my own laptop (the ancient one), too. Just the addition of that made the thing about a thousand times more useful. It's odd, but just having the capability to connect to the internet seemed to make the thing better. I know for a fact that I'm romanticizing now, but oh well. Life's short and you have to find your pleasures where you can.</p>

<p>Also, I just picked up World of Warcraft. I've been planning on using the free time I'll get over Christmas break to finish the first draft of my novel (which I still plan on doing, come hell or high water), but now I have to balance the time between writing and playing this kick ass game. If you're a fan of RPG's, check this one out. I don't usually go in for MMORPGs, but this is the first one I've found that's actually done <i>right</i>. You don't have to spend your life in front of the screen in order for it to be fun, and the gameplay is wonderful.</p>

<p>Anyway, I was excited and wanted to share...</p>
