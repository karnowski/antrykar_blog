<h3 class="title"><u>Fevre Dream</u> by George R.R. Martin</h3>

<p>First off, I have to say that <a href="http://www.georgerrmartin.com">George R.R. Martin</a> is one of my favorite authors. I have read several of his novels and short story collections, and have been very pleased with all of them. The novel <u>Fevre Dream</u> is no exception.</p>

<p>The novel is set, primarily, in the 1850's and is the story of a steamboat captain named Abner Marsh. In Marsh's recent past he went from a successful owner of five boats to a nearly-ruined owner of one after a harsh winter destroyed his four best steamboats. Because of this tragedy he is picked out by a Mr. Joshua York to help construct and run a new boat, which becomes known as the <i>Fevre Dream</i>. Mr. York is a trifle eccentric, and it does not take Marsh long to discover that his new partner is a vampire.</p>

<p>I don't want to give too much away about this novel, but I feel I have to say that this is not a typical vampire story. The vampires are not your usual undead blood-drinkers. In fact, that aren't undead at all. Martin has taken a very old subject and given it an original twist.</p>

<p>The story is wonderfully crafted and the setting is painted with the vividity that I've come to expect from Mr. Martin. As usual, his characters are real and have a depth to them that leaves you feeling as though you actually <i>know</i> them. </p>

<p>It is obvious that Martin did his research on what life was like for a member of a steamboat crew, as well as on steamboats themselves. I came away from the book having learned the major differences between side- and stern- wheel boats (one of which being the much higher level of manueverability that side-wheel boats possessed). While I may not have ever really <i>wanted</i> to know, the information was conveyed in an interesting way that kept the story moving forward.</p>

<p>If I was to have one gripe with this book, it would be that the story wasn't very suspenseful in the horror sense of the word. While there was definite suspense involved in the fate of certain characters, there wasn't much about the novel that left me feeling like I might have trouble sleeping. Which, as we all know, is the sign of a truly great horror novel.</p>

<p>Despite this, though, fans of both horror and historical novels should enjoy this book thoroughly, even if it's only because of the interesting combination of the two genres.</p>
