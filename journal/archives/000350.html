<h3 class="title">All We Have is Now</h3>

<p>As logic stands, you couldn't meet a man<br />
Who's from the future<br />
But logic broke; as he appeared he spoke<br />
About the Future</p>

<p>"We're not gonna make it..."<br />
He explained how the end will come<br />
You and me were never meant to be<br />
Part of the future</p>

<p>All we have is now<br />
All we've ever had was now<br />
All we have is now<br />
All we'll ever have is now</p>

<p>I noticed that he had a watch and hat<br />
That looked familiar<br />
He was me, from a dimension torn free<br />
Of the future</p>

<p>"We're not gonna make it..."<br />
He explained how the end will come<br />
You and me were never meant to be<br />
Part of the future</p>

<p>All we have is now<br />
All we've ever had was now<br />
All we have is now<br />
All we'll ever have is now</p>

<p>All we have is now</p>

<p>This is the second to last track on the album <b>Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots</b> by the <i>Flaming Lips</i>. I have listened to several of their records, and this is the only one that kicks my ass from beginning to end. It's one of those wonderful and rare albums that gets better with each listen.</p>

<p>There are a lot of people that have trouble getting past the guy's voice. It's a little high-pitched and almost whiney at times, but--I promise you--if you can acquire the taste for it, this album will quickly climb the ranks on your list of favorites.</p>

<p>It's a perfect Summertime album, even if it is a little depressing at times. The basic story of the album (though, to my knowledge, it is not a full-blown concept album. Some of the songs seem to fit nicely into the overall scheme, but some are a bit out of place as far as lyrics are concerned) is that evil, sentient machines begin to take over the world, and only Yoshimi can defeat them. Here are the lyrics for <i>Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots part 1</i>:</p>

<p>Her name is Yoshimi<br />
She's a black belt in karate<br />
Working for the city<br />
She has to discipline her body</p>

<p>Cause she knows that it's demanding to defeat those evil machines<br />
I know she can beat them</p>

<p>Oh Yoshimi<br />
They don't believe me<br />
But you won't let those<br />
Robots defeat me<br />
Oh Yoshimi<br />
They don't believe me<br />
But you won't let those<br />
Robots eat me</p>

<p>Those evil natured robots<br />
They're programmed to destroy us<br />
She's gotta be strong to fight them<br />
So she's taking lots of vitamins</p>

<p>Cause she knows that it'd be tragic<br />
If those evil robots win<br />
I know she can beat them </p>

<p><br />
Anyway, that tells you all about her. The album is amazing. It's a great mix of electric and organic instruments, and sounds like it should be the soundtrack for a movie. Each song takes you to a different part of the overall world, and leaves you wanting to know more about what happened. I strongly recommend this album to anyone that enjoys good music.</p>
