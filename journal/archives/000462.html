<h3 class="title">Mourning for Our Future.</h3>

<p>I really wanted to write something about the election yesterday, but I felt too sick about it to put anything remotely coherent together. I'm not sure how well I'll do today, either, but I figured I'd at least give it a go.</p>

<p>Alternating between disbelief, anger, and sadness, yesterday was one of the hardest days I've had to make it through in quite some time. I really believed that our nation would stand up and see through the smoke that surrounds President Bush. I thought it would become clear to them that his is an administration based on fear, mistrust, and hate.</p>

<p>I can't tell you how sad I am that I was wrong.</p>

<p>Based on the exit polls, somewhere around 84% of the people that voted for Bush said it was because of "moral" reasons. Meaning, or so I believe, that abortion is wrong and is the single most important issue in their lives. To this I have to ask: what is wrong with them?</p>

<p>How can a woman's choice to have a child or not possibly be more important than the state of our economy as a whole? How can it be more important than thirty years of environmental law being swept away so that the largest polluters in the world can go on polluting, filling their pockets even more at the same time? How can it possibly be more important than an unjustifiable war that has resulted in the deaths of over a thousand Americans, and will lead to many more deaths in the years to come?</p>

<p>Do the people that cite his "moral" leadership as the number one reason to vote for him not care that we, the middle and lower classes, are now poorer because of his policies? Or do they just not realize what's happening?</p>

<p>Don't get me wrong. I have no real problem with the people of this nation that decided Bush was the right man for the job. I do not wish them ill will, though there were times yesterday when it was all I could do to speak civilly to anyone, but I would like for them to step back and take an objective look at the state of our world as it is today. Do they <b>honestly</b> believe that the world is in better shape than it was four years ago? Do they <b>honestly</b> believe that we can expect anything to change for the better in the <b>next</b> four years?</p>

<p>If so, I wish they could explain it to me. </p>

<p>I wish that I could see some future that doesn't include the deaths of thousands of troops, the further weakening of our civil rights, and a greater gap between the haves and the have-nots. But I can't. I hope with all of my will that I'm wrong, but only time will tell.</p>

<p>Now that the Republicans have won control of <b>everything</b>, those of us interested in justice, compassion, and tolerance are really going to have our work cut out for us. It's tempting to just pack up and relocate to another country--I actually started investigating the possibility myself yesterday--but we can't give up hope. Not yet, anyway.</p>

<p>It is now our civic duty to fight the Right with everything in our power. They are masters of underhanded tactics, and it will be no small feat to learn how to combat that, but overcoming their tricks is something that <b>must</b> be done.</p>

<p>I ask you, all of you, to keep heart and remember that this is not total defeat. It is simply a set-back that we must work through if we are to reclaim the <b>true</b> ideas of our nation, those beloved concepts of liberty, justice, tolerance, and--above all else--equality.<br />
