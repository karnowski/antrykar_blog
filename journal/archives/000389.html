<h3 class="title"><u>Forgotten Prophecies</u> now available for order!!!</h3>

<p>Well, this week has been pretty exciting, and its only Tuesday. My book is now available for preorder with <a href="http://www.publishamerica.com/shopping/shopdisplayproducts.asp?catalogid=5492">Publish America</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1413725910/qid=1090952213/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/002-2395675-2513637?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">Amazon.com</a>, and <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?userid=ygx1PW1qEU&isbn=1413725910&itm=1">Barnes and Noble</a>. I got my two author copies, and it looks great. I can't express to you what it felt like to hold it in my hands and seeing the words I've read on a computer screen a thousand times on a printed page. Exhilarating.</p>

<p>And, even more exciting, I'm getting married tomorrow night! The ceremony is at 7:00 pm at Springbrook Park. Everyone is welcome.</p>

<p>I just finished making the mix CD. I've got just under 80 minutes of music, and I really hope it all works out... </p>

<p>Congratulations, Tony and Leslie!  The wedding was BEAUTIFUL.  It couldn't have been more perfect or better suited for you.  I really enjoyed myself, and I want to thank you so very much for including me.  I hate that Seth was not able to be home for it, but I think I got some good pictures that he will enjoy.  I wish you both all the luck and happiness in the world!</p>

<p>I'm sorry I missed it, but I was there in spirit.  The benevolent Obi-wan Kenobi kind of spirit, not the creepy Poltergeist kind.  Anyway, best of luck to you two, I'm very happy for you both.  Anybody have any pics of the event they can post for the poor souls in the opposite hemisphere?</p>

<p>We should have pics sometime soon, but I have none right now.</p>

<p>I wish you could have been there, too. I was happily surprised that Ben made it. It was great to have a member of the Englands representing.</p>

<p>Kip: Any word on the return home yet?</p>

<p>Tony and Leslie---Congratulations and ditto on the book Tony!!! Two more Englands would have been there if they could have. When Seth gets home we are going to celebrate at Hooters and hopefully we can get a musical celebration going with Frank Larry and Aaron doing some bluegrass!!!  </p>
