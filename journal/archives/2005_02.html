<p><b>The Ghost of Ronald Wilson</b> is now available for download through iTunes! It seems like it took forever, but it's finally there. You can listen to samples, download individual tracks, or even the whole album from the comfort of your favorite desk chair.</p>

<p><b>Cameron and the Grim</b> is much closer to being finished. I got the first draft done a couple of weeks ago, and I've been rewriting and trying to make it as good as can be. I think it's coming along pretty well, but only time will tell.</p>

<p>Let's see... what else? Oh yes, I'm scheduled to be at the Dogwood Arts Festival on April 17th here in Knoxville. I'm not real sure on most of the details right now, but I'll be sure to post them as soon as I do. Other than that, I think things have been pretty much the same as always. There's some more stuff in the works, but I'll hold off on saying anything until things are a little more finalized.</p>

<p>So, for now, that's all. Take care!</p>
