<h3 class="title">New Article</h3>

<p>Hey everyone! Sorry I haven't written anything in a while, but I've been busy at work and too tired when I got home to put anything up. I wanted to share with everyone, though, that I just sold another (this makes the third) article to a political website called Strike-the-Root.com. It's a pretty short piece, as I'm pretty short-winded at times. you can check it out here:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.strike-the-root.com/4/karnowski/karnowski1.html">http://www.strike-the-root.com/4/karnowski/karnowski1.html</a><br />
<em>[Editors note: I made the address a hyperlink for you, Tony -- Larry 03/25/04 1:26PM]</em></p>

<p>I don't remember how to do a hyperlink in HTML, so you'll have to copy and paste if you want to read it. Do you still have that book I lent you, Frank? I may need to borrow it back soon so I can remember how to do it, unless someone wants to just tell me here.</p>

<p>Anyway, things are good. Leslie and I gt our new bed last Friday, and let me tell you, it is awesome. Best sleep I've had in over a year, easily.</p>

<p>Our new puppy, Petra (no, I did not name her after that horrible 80's Christian band), is doing very well. She and Ender have become good friends, and the two of them are doing well. She's pretty much house-broken now (I'm amazed... it didn't take as long as I thought it would) although we have to kennel her when we aren't home or she does very bad things like get into Leslie's meds. She didn't eat any, though, thank God.</p>

<p>Anyway, I guess that about wraps it up for now... Let me know what you all think of that article if you read it. You can post opinions here or on that site, or both... Whichever you prefer...</p>

<h3 class="title">Out of Time</h3>

<p>Where's the love song<br />
To set us free<br />
Too many people down<br />
Everything turning the wrong way around</p>

<p>And I don't know what<br />
Love will be<br />
If we stop dreaming now<br />
Lord knows we'll never clear the clouds</p>

<p>And you've been so busy lately<br />
That you haven't found the time<br />
To open up your mind<br />
And watch the world spinning<br />
Gently out of time</p>

<p>Feel the sun shine on your face<br />
This ain't a computer now<br />
Gone are the futures<br />
Way out in space</p>

<p>And you've been so busy lately<br />
That you haven't found the time<br />
To open up your mind<br />
And watch the world spinning<br />
Gently out of time</p>

<p>And you've been so busy lately<br />
That you haven't found the time<br />
To open up your mind<br />
And watch the world spinning<br />
Gently out of time</p>

<p>Tell me I'm not dreaming<br />
But are we out of time</p>

<p>We're out of time</p>

<p><br />
I'm not sure I have all of these lyrics 100% correct, so if any of you listen to Blur and can correct me, please do so.</p>

<p>This song is amazing. The lyrics themselves aren't the greatest, but when put to music they really bring the song to life... Anyway, you should all be listening to Think Tank by Blur. It's a great album. While you're at it, go back listen to their other albums, too. You shouldn't be disappointed...</p>

<h3 class="title">Punch Up at a Wedding</h3>

<p>I don't know<br />
Why you bother<br />
Nothing's ever good enough for you</p>

<p>I was there<br />
And it wasn't like that<br />
You've come here just to start a fight</p>

<p>You had to piss on our parade<br />
You had to shred our big day<br />
You had to ruin it for all concerned<br />
In a drunken punch-up at a wedding</p>

<p>Hypocrite<br />
Opportunist<br />
Don't infect me with your poison</p>

<p>Bully in a china shop<br />
When I turn round you stay frozen to the spot</p>

<p>You pulled the snide remarks<br />
Off lamenated charts<br />
The pot will call the kettle black<br />
It's a drunken punch-up at a wedding</p>

<p>---God I love <a href="http://www.radiohead.com">Radiohead</a>. That's really all I have to say about this one...</p>

<h3 class="title">Donating to Science</h3>

<p>There goes the girl I know<br />
She got me good in a little world<br />
And my head has long since exloded<br />
All over the neighborhood</p>

<p>Times like these make me long for a friend<br />
They make her long for the simple life<br />
Cause she's already twenty-two years older<br />
Than the rest of the night</p>

<p>But don't feel sad for me<br />
For my compassion has gone away<br />
And even if I could<br />
I probably wouldn't feel any anyway</p>

<p>I won't sing of stories of love<br />
Since I donated my heart to science<br />
Now, I won't feel the sting of thorns in my pride<br />
Since they raped me of my self-reliance</p>

<p>So here I come, baby, I'm crashing through walls<br />
I'm your half-drunk Superman<br />
But she conquered me with kryptonite<br />
Least that's the version that she tells to friends</p>

<p>But don't feel bad for me <br />
For now the wreckage has washed ashore<br />
Underneath the tie <br />
We're all laughing forevermore</p>

<p>I won't sing of stories of love<br />
Since I donated my heart to science<br />
Now, I won't feel the sting of thorns in my pride<br />
Since they raped me of my self-reliance</p>

<p>This song by Self has been kicking my ass ever since I snagged it off their <a href="http://www.selfmusic.net">website</a>. It has a very strong Jellyfish flavor to it and is brilliantly orchestrated...</p>

<h3 class="title">The Maiden Blog</h3>

<p>This is basically a test. I will probably come back and add something worth reading (maybe) later on today, but I just want to make sure the thing is actually functioning. It's not that I don't trust my brother, I just don't trust technology...</p>
