<h3 class="title">David Bowie in Atlanta</h3>

<p>Saturday night Leslie and I went to Chastain Park Amphitheatre in Atlanta to see <a href="http://www.davidbowie.com">David Bowie</a> play. The venue was one of the nicest I've ever attended, but had a very controlled, almost oppressed, air. There were more staff and police officers present than I have ever seen at a concert--except maybe Lollapalooza, although I don't recall a <i>real</i> heavy police presence there, either. But overall, the venue was pretty well-run and beautiful.</p>

<p>A band called <a href="http://www.stereophonics.com/stereophonics.html">Stereophonics</a> opened up and put on a pretty good show. I was unfamiliar with their work going in, so I probably didn't enjoy it as much as I could have. They had a post-pop feel, with plenty of talent and musicianship displayed. I plan on checking out some of their studio work soon.</p>

<p>Bowie - What can I say, really, that hasn't probably already been said? The man is a genius, and he has the ability to put together a really great band. Every one of the musicians on that stage played beautifully, with only one mistake that I picked up on through out the whole show. And, let me stress, that one mistake was <i>tiny</i>. The show was a pretty good mix of old and new songs. Going in I was a little concerned that it would be only new material, but when he opened with "Rebel, Rebel" those concerns melted away. I would have liked to have heard more from the <i>Earthling</i> and <i>Outside</i> periods, but he did play some of the best songs from both of those albums, including "I'm Afraid of Americans," which I thought was a little brave considering the crowd.</p>

<p>I was amazed by the number of white-collar conservative types at the show. I'm sorry, but I had to say it. It was just surprising to me to be at a show where I had expected the seats to be filled with goths and other assorted weirdos, and find them, instead, occupied by people decked out in 80's attire or looking like they just walked off the golf course. Not that there weren't a few freaks mixed in with the bunch. There were several people gothed or ziggyed out for the show.</p>

<p>All in all, it was an experience. I'm not sure it was worth the ticket price plus the drive, but I am glad I got to see him play. That's just one more thing I can scratch off the list...</p>

<p>The punks and freaks of yesterday are the conservatives of today, I suppose.  Age can do terrible, terrible things to a person.</p>

<p>I'm pretty jealous Tony... I've never seen Bowie live, and I'd love to!  I'm glad he played a good mix of old and new stuff.  Too bad he's not coming anywhere near NC.  I'd say Val and Kip have a better chance of seeing him in Tokyo than here. ;-)</p>

<p>Yeah, I don't know if he's playing in NC at all. If he comes anywhere close you should check it out, though. I can't express how good it was...</p>
