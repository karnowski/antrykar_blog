<h3 class="title">The Laptop is Fixed!</h3>

<p>It turns out that the RAM had come a little loose in my laptop and was causing the aforementioned problems. I dusted the area out, resat the RAM an now everything seems to be working fine.</p>

<p>I'm so happy I feel like dancing. Which, as anyone who knows me can verify, is a very rare occurence...</p>

<h3 class="title">Blah freaking Blah</h3>

<p>The title says it all for today. It's been rainy and shitty all day, and I can feel my mood sinking into the lower depths of hades about now. I did manage to get a decent start on a new novel I'm writing which I'm tentatively calling <b>The Sacred Magicks of Elrinm the Mage</b> which, oddly enough, primarily takes place in the greater Knoxville area. I want to give a go at working real life into a fantasy story (or working fantasy into a Real Life story, depending on how you want to look at it), and this will be my first real attempt. I hope to God it works out. Anyway, I got about 3,000 words written, and I really don't feel good about a single one of them. Well, the third "the" I used seems all right, but the rest just seem like rubbish.</p>

<p>Oh well. That's what the delete key is for, I suppose.</p>

<p>Anyway, I just felt like blogging for a minute. I don't really have anything to report. All things considered, Life is treating me pretty well at the moment, except for this small problem with my laptop. Sometimes (most of the time now, actually) when I try to boot up the screen won't come on and the thing starts beeping at me. I've managed to back everything up so if there's a meltdown I won't have lost anything, but I'm not looking forward to spending God-knows-how-long waiting for it to come back from repair after I send it. Which, I'm still not sure I'm going to do. I've become hopelessly dependent on this little machine, and I can't really imagine life without the ability to write from the couch anymore.</p>

<p>If any of you have any thoughts on what might be causing the problem, please let me know. I really don't want to send it away. It's my precious...</p>

<h3 class="title">Point of Fear</h3>

<p>Ron and I met with Brooks Benjamin of Lycan Entertainment, an independant film company based in East Tennessee, on Sunday evening to discuss his new film <a href="http://www.pointoffear.com">Point of Fear</a>. It seems Ron and I (Citizen X) will be dong the score for the film. We're both really excited about this, especially since the movie really seems like it's going to rock. We watched the opening sequence, and I was completely blown away. Brooks is really talented, and I can't wait to see the rest of the film. If you're in to horror (or, more appropriately, thrillers) you're going to want to check this film out.</p>
