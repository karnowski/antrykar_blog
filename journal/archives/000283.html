<h3 class="title">Sweet, Terrible Pain</h3>

<p>So, my friend Ron, who some of you know, said to me not too long ago: (paraphrased) One day I'm going to be old, and I'll start physically degrading. Why not, then, get myself into as good a shape now, while I'm in the prime of my life, as I can? That way, when I start falling apart, I'll have a ot more to lose before I hit bottom.</p>

<p>That really struck a cord with me. Because of that and Leslie's persistance, I decided that the time to start working out has finally come. So, I went Sunday and let Leslie coach me throuh a work-out.</p>

<p>It was about thirty-minutes, and wasn't (or so I thought at the time) too terribly strenuous. However, two days later, I'm beginning to realize a couple of things. First, I am <i>really</i> out of shape. And second, that work-out kicked my ass. I have never been so sore in my life. I feel like my arms are about to fall off, and any movement of my arms (except for typing, which is more an exercise of the fingers, anyway) results in the kind of pain I have spent most of my life avoiding.</p>

<p>Now, I know if I keep at this the pain will recede and I'll feel a lot better, but damn. I didn't expect to feel like this.</p>

<p>Ok, I'm done bitching about that now.</p>

<p>I have also quit smoking (again). This time it's going to catch though. I made it six months last year, and I refuse to be a slave to nicotine. I'm the master of my own destiny, dammit! (read: I realy want a cig right now, and am trying to convince myself not to smoke.)</p>

<p>Although, I really don't <i>need</i> or even <i>want</i> a cigarette, it's just the nicotine talking. And I refuse to listen.</p>

<p>There hasn't been too much else going on. I've been spending a lot of time at <a href="http://www.neilgaiman.com">neilgaiman.com</a> lately. He's one of my favorite authors, and he blogs! It's great. You should check his site out, as well as his work. If you're looking for a couple of good reads check out <i>Neverwhere</i>, <i>American Gods</i>, and <i>Good Omens</i>. The last was a collaboration he did with Terry Pratchett about the return on the Anti-Christ. While you may be surprised to hear this, it was freaking hilarious.</p>

<p>Anyway, go check out Neil, and hopefully I'll write more again soon.</p>
