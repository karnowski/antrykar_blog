<p>Well, October is almost on us, which means Halloween isn't too far away. And, because of this, I decided to start the season a little early by breaking out this tune. As is true of most of <a href="http://www.selfmusic.net">Matt Mahafey's</a> lyrics, these aren't quite the same without the melody and music behind them, but they still crack me up. If you haven't by now, you should follow that little link to <a href="http://www.selfmusic.net">Matt's website</a> and listen to some of the B-Sides from Self's as-yet-unreleased album, <i>Ornament and Crime</i>, which I am anxiously awaiting.<br />
</p>

<p>Anyway, the song above, KiDdIeS, can be found on the album <i>Half-Baked Serenades</i>. It may be a little hard to come by these days, but I would say a copy could be found on <a href="http://www.half.com>Half.com</a> or some other, simliar site. It's worth it, and I promise you won't be disappointed by it!!!</p>

<p>Hey everyone! Just wanted to drop a quick note here to let you all know that that band I'm a member of, you know, <a href="http://www.citizenxensemble.com">Citizen X</a>, has just released its second album. <u>The Ghost of Ronald Wilson</u> is available <a href="http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/citizenx2">here</a> through <a href="http://www.cdbaby.com">CD Baby</a>. There are samples of all of the songs that you can listen to, though I think they're only 30-seconds long. The album will also be available from iTunes, Napster, and most of the other online music retailers soon. I'll keep you posted on that.</p>

<p>I'm really happy with the way the album turned out. I think it is a large step forward for our composing and recording skills, not to mention our playing abilities.</p>

<p>Go <a href="http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/citizenx2">give it a listen</a>!</p>

<h3 class="title">All We Have is Now</h3>

<p>As logic stands, you couldn't meet a man<br />
Who's from the future<br />
But logic broke; as he appeared he spoke<br />
About the Future</p>

<p>"We're not gonna make it..."<br />
He explained how the end will come<br />
You and me were never meant to be<br />
Part of the future</p>

<p>All we have is now<br />
All we've ever had was now<br />
All we have is now<br />
All we'll ever have is now</p>

<p>I noticed that he had a watch and hat<br />
That looked familiar<br />
He was me, from a dimension torn free<br />
Of the future</p>

<p>"We're not gonna make it..."<br />
He explained how the end will come<br />
You and me were never meant to be<br />
Part of the future</p>

<p>All we have is now<br />
All we've ever had was now<br />
All we have is now<br />
All we'll ever have is now</p>

<p>All we have is now</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sing365.com/music/Lyric.nsf/All-We-Have-Is-Now-lyrics-The-Flaming-Lips/90AAECA52226CA1148256C14001E01E3">Source of the lyrics.</a></p>

<p>This is the second to last track on the album <b>Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots</b> by the <i>Flaming Lips</i>. I have listened to several of their records, and this is the only one that kicks my ass from beginning to end. It's one of those wonderful and rare albums that gets better with each listen.</p>

<p>There are a lot of people that have trouble getting past the guy's voice. It's a little high-pitched and almost whiney at times, but--I promise you--if you can acquire the taste for it, this album will quickly climb the ranks on your list of favorites.</p>

<p>It's a perfect Summertime album, even if it is a little depressing at times. The basic story of the album (though, to my knowledge, it is not a full-blown concept album. Some of the songs seem to fit nicely into the overall scheme, but some are a bit out of place as far as lyrics are concerned) is that evil, sentient machines begin to take over the world, and only Yoshimi can defeat them. Here are the lyrics for <i>Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots part 1</i>:</p>

<p>Her name is Yoshimi<br />
She's a black belt in karate<br />
Working for the city<br />
She has to discipline her body</p>

<p>Cause she knows that it's demanding to defeat those evil machines<br />
I know she can beat them</p>

<p>Oh Yoshimi<br />
They don't believe me<br />
But you won't let those<br />
Robots defeat me<br />
Oh Yoshimi<br />
They don't believe me<br />
But you won't let those<br />
Robots eat me</p>

<p>Those evil natured robots<br />
They're programmed to destroy us<br />
She's gotta be strong to fight them<br />
So she's taking lots of vitamins</p>

<p>Cause she knows that it'd be tragic<br />
If those evil robots win<br />
I know she can beat them </p>

<p><a href="http://www.sing365.com/music/Lyric.nsf/Yoshimi-Battles-the-Pink-Robots-Pt-1-lyrics-The-Flaming-Lips/BFF7AB9DCC549A3D48256C14001E1DC9">Source of the lyrics.</a></p>

<p><br />
Anyway, that tells you all about her. The album is amazing. It's a great mix of electric and organic instruments, and sounds like it should be the soundtrack for a movie. Each song takes you to a different part of the overall world, and leaves you wanting to know more about what happened. I strongly recommend this album to anyone that enjoys good music.</p>

<h3 class="title">Fake Plastic Trees</h3>

<p>Her green plastic watering can<br />
For her fake chinese rubber plant<br />
In fake plastic earth.<br />
That she bought from a rubber man<br />
In a town full of rubber plants<br />
Just to get rid of itself.<br />
And it wears her out, it wears her out<br />
It wears her out, it wears her out.</p>

<p>She lives with a broken man<br />
A cracked polystyrene man<br />
Who just crumbles and burns.<br />
He used to do surgery<br />
For girls in the eighties<br />
But gravity always wins.<br />
And it wears him out, it wears him out<br />
It wears him out, it wears him out.</p>

<p>She looks like the real thing<br />
She tastes like the real thing<br />
My fake plastic love.<br />
But I can’t help the feeling<br />
I could blow through the ceiling<br />
If I just turn and run<br />
And it wears me out, it wears me out<br />
It wears me out, it wears me out.</p>

<p>And if I could be who you wanted<br />
If I could be who you wanted,<br />
All the time, all the time, ohhh... ohh...</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/r/radiohead/113257.html">Source of the lyrics.</a></p>

<p>I'm pretty sure I've raved about Radiohead on this thing before somewhere, but they're so good I feel it bears repeating. Out of all the other bands alive and active at this time, Radiohead is in the top 3, easy. This song, while being fairly old, still has the power to stir emotion in me. Hell, the whole album (<i>The Bends</i>) is amazing. </p>

<p>The lines:<br />
He used to do surgery<br />
For girls in the eighties<br />
But Gravity always wins<br />
It wears him out...</p>

<p>just kill me. Old Thom Yorke has talent with words. While that may not strike many as profound, it speaks volumes to me. And, I have no doubt, those volumes were never intended by Mr. Yorke and Co.</p>

<p>I really don't know where I'm going with this. I as just listening to this album and felt like I had to post something about it.</p>

<h3 class="title">One more for Citizen X</h3>

<p>Our new manager, Zac, delivered 10 copies (5 each) to both the Disc Exchange locations in K-town. The West store has a copy on their listening bar somewhere. I'm not sure if it will be with the Local's Section (which is where the CD can be found) or somewhere else, but I'm sure the friendly staff can point you in the direction if you want to give it a listen.</p>

<p>It's going to be hard to get a buzz going about us since we don't really have a band (it's just me and Ron), so I need to ask all of you that have heard it to <b>PLEASE</b> pass the word about us. The album is very eclectic, and has something for everyone.</p>

<p>If anyone asks what it sounds like, I always tell them it's the musical equivalent of mutant zombies dancing beneath a flame-ridden sky.</p>

<p>It always raises eyebrows, and has actually inspired a couple of people to find out exactly what that sounds like.</p>

<p>Anyway. Thanks everyone for any help you may (and/or have) give(n).</p>

<h3 class="title">Citizen X Merchandise</h3>

<p>The musical outfit that I make up half of, <a href="http://www.citizenxensemble.com">Citizen X</a>, now has a couple of t-shirts and stickers available through <a href="http://cafepress.com">Cafe Press</a>. You can see our shopfront <a href="http://www.cafeshops.com/citizenxshop">here</a>.</p>

<p>There aren't too many to choose from at the moment, but I will be adding more designs as time goes by.</p>

<p>I should, hopefully, have shirts and other merchandise featuring characters from my new novel, <u>Forgotten Prophecies</u>, before too much longer. My good friend Mark Trotter is currently working on the art. He's an amazing artist, and I know that anything he comes up with will be top-notch.</p>

<p>As far as when the novel will be out, I still don't have a firm date, but I received the digital proofs from my editor last Friday. In the message I wa told that I can expect to see it in print in no longer than 3 months. That's going to give us a possible release date of late August, early September. I'll be sure to keep everyone up-to-date.</p>

<p>Saturday night Leslie and I went to Chastain Park Amphitheatre in Atlanta to see <a href="http://www.davidbowie.com">David Bowie</a> play. The venue was one of the nicest I've ever attended, but had a very controlled, almost oppressed, air. There were more staff and police officers present than I have ever seen at a concert--except maybe Lollapalooza, although I don't recall a <i>real</i> heavy police presence there, either. But overall, the venue was pretty well-run and beautiful.</p>

<p>A band called <a href="http://www.stereophonics.com/stereophonics.html">Stereophonics</a> opened up and put on a pretty good show. I was unfamiliar with their work going in, so I probably didn't enjoy it as much as I could have. They had a post-pop feel, with plenty of talent and musicianship displayed. I plan on checking out some of their studio work soon.</p>

<p>Bowie - What can I say, really, that hasn't probably already been said? The man is a genius, and he has the ability to put together a really great band. Every one of the musicians on that stage played beautifully, with only one mistake that I picked up on through out the whole show. And, let me stress, that one mistake was <i>tiny</i>. The show was a pretty good mix of old and new songs. Going in I was a little concerned that it would be only new material, but when he opened with "Rebel, Rebel" those concerns melted away. I would have liked to have heard more from the <i>Earthling</i> and <i>Outside</i> periods, but he did play some of the best songs from both of those albums, including "I'm Afraid of Americans," which I thought was a little brave considering the crowd.</p>

<p>I was amazed by the number of white-collar conservative types at the show. I'm sorry, but I had to say it. It was just surprising to me to be at a show where I had expected the seats to be filled with goths and other assorted weirdos, and find them, instead, occupied by people decked out in 80's attire or looking like they just walked off the golf course. Not that there weren't a few freaks mixed in with the bunch. There were several people gothed or ziggyed out for the show.</p>

<p>All in all, it was an experience. I'm not sure it was worth the ticket price plus the drive, but I am glad I got to see him play. That's just one more thing I can scratch off the list...</p>

<h3 class="title">She Still Loves Him</h3>

<p>He writes her a letter<br />
Tells her he won't be lonesome - she still loves him<br />
He lost his temper<br />
And belted his love 'cross the room - she still loves him</p>

<p>Drinks when he's sad<br />
Gets happy then mad at the world - she still loves him<br />
Never remembers<br />
That day in September when wed - she still loves him</p>

<p>So she recalls the days when they were younger<br />
Flowers could heal her wounds<br />
But now those days are long since gone forever<br />
Now her pain just fills every room</p>

<p>Faces aglow<br />
As the light from the T.V. show just separates them now - she still loves him<br />
All they wanted to be<br />
Was as happy as couple #3 on their favorite game show - she still loves him</p>

<p>He recalls the days when they were younger<br />
The future could heal their wounds<br />
But now those days are long since gone forever<br />
Now her pain just fills every room</p>

<p>I know someday this will all work out<br />
She'll never face this alone<br />
The light in her eyes may be flickering dim<br />
But she still loves him</p>

<p>This song was written by Andrew Sturmer for the Jellyfish, quite possibly the world's most under-rated band ever. The song appears on <u>Bellybutton</u>, their first album, which was released in 1990. The album sold well, had a few hits on the college charts, and they were expected to go on to do great things. Their second album, <u>Spilt Milk</u>, is unbelievable. It is a masterpiece that never got the recognition it deserves because the record label didn't put enough into the marketing. Because of this lack of label support, the album didn't sale well, and I'll never get to have a new Jellyfish album to listen to.</p>

<p>It's a travesty.</p>

<h3 class="title">Superman's Song</h3>

<p>Tarzan wasn't a ladies' man<br />
He'd just come along and scoop 'em up under his arm<br />
Like that, quick as a cat in the jungle<br />
But Clark Kent, now there was a real gent<br />
He would not be caught sittin' around in no<br />
Junglescape, dumb as an ape doing nothing</p>

<p>Superman never made any money<br />
For saving the world from Solomon Grundy<br />
And sometimes I despair the world will never see<br />
Another man like him</p>

<p>Hey Bob, Supe had a straight job<br />
Even though he could have smashed through any bank<br />
In the United States, he had the strength, but he would not<br />
Folks said his family were all dead<br />
Their planet crumbled but Superman, he forced himself<br />
To carry on, forget Krypton, and keep going</p>

<p>Superman never made any money<br />
For saving the world from Solomon Grundy<br />
And sometimes I despair the world will never see<br />
Another man like him</p>

<p>Tarzan was king of the jungle and Lord over all the apes<br />
But he could hardly string together four words: "I Tarzan, You Jane."</p>

<p>Sometimes when Supe was stopping crimes<br />
I'll bet that he was tempted to just quit and turn his back<br />
On man, join Tarzan in the forest<br />
But he stayed in the city, and kept on changing clothes<br />
In dirty old phonebooths till his work was through<br />
And nothing to do but go on home</p>

<p>Superman never made any money<br />
For saving the world from Solomon Grundy<br />
And sometimes I despair the world will never see<br />
Another man like him</p>

<p>I broke this album (<i>The Ghosts That Haunt Me</i> by The Crash Test Dummies) out the other day, and have been really impressed by how good it is. I remember listening to it some with Larry back in the day, but I had never really gotten into it. This song has been standing out as one of the best on the album. It is surprisingly sad and moving. I mean, how often do you hear a - <i>truly</i> - sad song based on Superman?</p>

<h3 class="title">Out of Time</h3>

<p>Where's the love song<br />
To set us free<br />
Too many people down<br />
Everything turning the wrong way around</p>

<p>And I don't know what<br />
Love will be<br />
If we stop dreaming now<br />
Lord knows we'll never clear the clouds</p>

<p>And you've been so busy lately<br />
That you haven't found the time<br />
To open up your mind<br />
And watch the world spinning<br />
Gently out of time</p>

<p>Feel the sun shine on your face<br />
This ain't a computer now<br />
Gone are the futures<br />
Way out in space</p>

<p>And you've been so busy lately<br />
That you haven't found the time<br />
To open up your mind<br />
And watch the world spinning<br />
Gently out of time</p>

<p>And you've been so busy lately<br />
That you haven't found the time<br />
To open up your mind<br />
And watch the world spinning<br />
Gently out of time</p>

<p>Tell me I'm not dreaming<br />
But are we out of time</p>

<p>We're out of time</p>

<p><br />
I'm not sure I have all of these lyrics 100% correct, so if any of you listen to Blur and can correct me, please do so.</p>

<p>This song is amazing. The lyrics themselves aren't the greatest, but when put to music they really bring the song to life... Anyway, you should all be listening to Think Tank by Blur. It's a great album. While you're at it, go back listen to their other albums, too. You shouldn't be disappointed...</p>

<h3 class="title">Punch Up at a Wedding</h3>

<p>I don't know<br />
Why you bother<br />
Nothing's ever good enough for you</p>

<p>I was there<br />
And it wasn't like that<br />
You've come here just to start a fight</p>

<p>You had to piss on our parade<br />
You had to shred our big day<br />
You had to ruin it for all concerned<br />
In a drunken punch-up at a wedding</p>

<p>Hypocrite<br />
Opportunist<br />
Don't infect me with your poison</p>

<p>Bully in a china shop<br />
When I turn round you stay frozen to the spot</p>

<p>You pulled the snide remarks<br />
Off lamenated charts<br />
The pot will call the kettle black<br />
It's a drunken punch-up at a wedding</p>

<p>---God I love <a href="http://www.radiohead.com">Radiohead</a>. That's really all I have to say about this one...</p>

<h3 class="title">Donating to Science</h3>

<p>There goes the girl I know<br />
She got me good in a little world<br />
And my head has long since exloded<br />
All over the neighborhood</p>

<p>Times like these make me long for a friend<br />
They make her long for the simple life<br />
Cause she's already twenty-two years older<br />
Than the rest of the night</p>

<p>But don't feel sad for me<br />
For my compassion has gone away<br />
And even if I could<br />
I probably wouldn't feel any anyway</p>

<p>I won't sing of stories of love<br />
Since I donated my heart to science<br />
Now, I won't feel the sting of thorns in my pride<br />
Since they raped me of my self-reliance</p>

<p>So here I come, baby, I'm crashing through walls<br />
I'm your half-drunk Superman<br />
But she conquered me with kryptonite<br />
Least that's the version that she tells to friends</p>

<p>But don't feel bad for me <br />
For now the wreckage has washed ashore<br />
Underneath the tie <br />
We're all laughing forevermore</p>

<p>I won't sing of stories of love<br />
Since I donated my heart to science<br />
Now, I won't feel the sting of thorns in my pride<br />
Since they raped me of my self-reliance</p>

<p>This song by Self has been kicking my ass ever since I snagged it off their <a href="http://www.selfmusic.net">website</a>. It has a very strong Jellyfish flavor to it and is brilliantly orchestrated...</p>
