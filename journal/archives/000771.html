<h3 class="title">Revoluticon and Serenity</h3>

<p>This past Saturday was spent in Asheville at Revoluticon. It was a very small and very young con, but I had a great time. My reading was the most successful I've had yet, even though I was so nervous I could barely look up from the podium. I'm hoping I'll get better at these presentations as I do more. Thanks to everyone that attended, asked questions, and bought a book afterwards!</p>

<p>On a different note, Leslie and I finally went to see Serenity yesterday afternoon. I've been dying to see it, but due to our schedules and having to be out of town, I had to wait. It was worth it. Fans of the short-lived Firefly tv show will not be disappointed, and any newcomers should be able to fall right in with the story line. This is sci-fi as it should be. The focus of the film was were it should be: on the characters and the story. While the special effects were out-standing, you could tell that Joss Whedon views them as he should: as a tool withwhich to tell a story. Unlike some sci-fi movies these days (Star Wars, anyone?), the story wasn't there to support the special effects. The action sequences were well done and not too over the top. All in all, it was a really great flick. </p>
