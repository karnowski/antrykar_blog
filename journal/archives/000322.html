<h3 class="title">Illusory Elections</h3>

<p>It’s an election year. That magical time that rolls through every four years when Americans are given the chance to decide who they think is best suited to act as our President. Actually, let me rephrase that—it is the time when Americans are given the <i>illusion</i> of choosing their leader. The truth is that no matter whom we, the American populace, choose to lead our nation, our choice has no real bearing on who actually gets the job.</p>

<p>If one needs proof of this, all they have to do is look to our current President. In a nation where the majority is supposed to rule, we should have a different forty-third president than we do. Bush did not receive the popular vote, but still won the election. How can this be?</p>

<p>I know; I know . . . The Electoral College—that wonderful system based on the ancient Roman system called the Centurial Assembly. How could I possibly forget that?</p>

<p>The Electoral College was created and implemented at a time when the country was much smaller. Since its inception, the Nation has grown considerably, and many things have changed. The number of states in the Union has changed, the number of citizens has changed, technology has changed—drastically—but the Electoral College remains in place.</p>

<p>I’ve come to a place in my life where I’ve begun to question many of the practices of our government. One of the most frequent that pops in my head is how much does my vote really count. You hear people say—hell, I’ve said it myself—“You need to vote! How else can we make a difference? How else can we let our voice be heard?” Deep down, I want to believe that my vote does matter, that my vote does count for something, but I’m beginning to believe that it is nothing more than a ploy by the government to make me feel like I have some say in the way this country is being run.</p>

<p>Since I turned 18, I have voted in every national election I could, but I have never seen my vote make anything happen. I have talked to many people who have gone to the polls, hoping to have their voice heard in Washington, and I don’t know anyone that feels like their vote has accomplished anything.</p>

<p>So, if we are a nation that is supposed to be run <i>by</i> the people, how is it that our votes don’t seem to be doing anything? Are we doing something wrong? If so, what? Is there anything we can do that might make a larger impact on the people that are supposed to be doing what we tell them?</p>

<p>After much thought, I have come up with a proposition. Now, hear me out before you discount it, as it is a little off-kilter. This year, instead of rallying people together to vote for Kerry or Bush or Nader, why not work to convince <i>no one</i> to vote. Make a stand and say that we don’t want any of those people in charge. Stand up and say we’re sick of having to choose between one of a couple of puppets, and simply refuse to vote. Pass out flyers and buttons and hold rallies and convince everyone to stay home on Election Day. </p>

<p>Seriously, what would happen if no one went to the polls this year? Would someone still get elected? If they did, wouldn’t it be painfully obvious at that point that our votes really <i>don’t</i> count? Would they be forced to reevaluate the current system and come up with something else?</p>

<p>I know what most of you are thinking: “<i>Not</i> vote? I can’t do that! I have to have my voice heard! I have to perform that meaningless ritual again so that I can feel like I’ve done something for my country!” I understand where these thoughts and doubts come from; I suffer from them as well. But until the American People stand up for themselves and let Washington know that we don’t like the way things are being run, the politicians are going to continue to do what they want.</p>

<p>I’ve racked my brain to think of some way that we can make a difference in a non-violent way. Violence is counterproductive and is one of the key issues I have with our current government. How quick are they to turn to violence? It seems to me that diplomacy is a relic of days passed. But how else, I’ve asked myself, can we make them take us seriously? How can we make sure that our voice is heard? By telling them, through our refusal to vote, that we are sick of their corrupt systems and demand a change.</p>

<p>I know this is a pipe dream. I know there are too many people hopelessly lost to the system for this to ever work. What would end up happening, is that three or four people (in all probability it would be a <i>much</i> larger number) in each state would still go, and those votes would be the only ones to be counted. They would probably all be Bush supporters, too.</p>

<p>But, if nothing else, hopefully this will help wake us up and make us start thinking about new ways to get our voices heard. Maybe we can discover some new tactic that could actually make a difference.</p>

<p>I have friends that go to protests and feel like they are accomplishing something. I am a fervent believer that protesting is a thing of the past. It doesn’t work anymore, if it ever really did. But unless we come up with something soon, we’re going to be trapped under the heel of a government that does what they want—when they want—without considering what we, the People, think. </p>

<p>I don’t want to live under that kind of government, do you?<br />

<p>You're right that protests don't work, but lawsuits do.  Especially in the corporate sector.  I wonder if there is a way to incorporate that into your protest.  Could you sue an elected official for breach of contract?  Hmmm.  If you do end up going with violence, I can train you up some rock'n roll chimps pretty quick.......</p>

<p>Rock-n-roll chimps may be the answer I've been looking for!!! How could I have been so stupid as to overlook that factor?</p>
