<h3 class="title"><u>Dark Tower VI: Song of Susannah</u> by <a href="http://www.stephenking.com">Stephen King,</a></h3>

<p>I first discovered Stephen King's <u>Dark Tower</u> series when I was in middle school (I can't remember which grade specifically, but I know it was after I started sixth but before I finished eighth) with <u>The Gunslinger</u>. Even now I can't say what exactly it was about the series that gripped me so tightly. There is just something about the main chracter, Roland Deschain of Gilead (referred to frequently as "Old long, tall, and ugly), that speaks of more than just a character in a book. While the whole cast of characters possess a sense of reality that is rare in most novels (most of King's other titles included), there is something about Roland that makes you feel like you've known him your whole life. I'm not sure if it's because he's some sort of all-encompassing archetypal hero, or if it's just that there is so much <i>depth</i> to the character. I have never experienced another protagonist that makes you change your opinion of him so often.</p>

<p>Of course, most of the “Do I like him or hate him?” questioning happened in the first couple of books, but every now and then you have to wonder if the last of the line of the Eld really has the best interests of his ka-tet (Ka is a word used to mean, although it is not limited to just this definition, destiny. A ka-tet is a group that work together to achieve ka’s goals) in mind.</p>

<p>This, the sixth book in the series, continues the story line beautifully. I never know what to expect when I pick up a new <u>Dark Tower</u> book, but in the end it’s never anything like I thought it would be. Many plot-lines that felt unfinished at the end of the last book were tied off, but, like any series-book worth its salt, it raised almost as many questions as it answered. </p>

<p>There were a few things that happened that struck me as odd, story-wise that is, the most prominent being the introduction of a new character. I don’t want to give anything away, but if you read the novel you’ll know exactly who I’m talking about. I had some prior knowledge that it was going to happen, but it still took me a little off guard anyway. I remember thinking to myself that, because of this certain character’s inclusion, King is either brilliant or the most pretentious author in the world. I have to admit, though, I’m leaning toward the former.</p>

<p>I only have two gripes with this novel. The first is the length. At 411 pages, it left me feeling a little like a kid that tears open the package of his latest G.I. Joe action figure to find out that Hasbro left out not only the weapons, but the guy’s legs, too. If there is indeed only one more book left in the series (which I don’t doubt) that thing better be at least 650 pages. Preferably a thousand. I feel like he’s going to need at least that many to end this with anything remotely resembling finality. But that’s just me. </p>

<p>The second problem I have is with the ending. It was almost as bad as the ending of <u>The Waste Lands</u>, the third novel in the series. Maybe even worse. Don’t get me wrong, I enjoy a good cliffhanger as much as the next guy, but this just left me feeling robbed. I turned the last page and thought to myself: “That bastard… How could he end it like <I>that</I>? Now I have to wait three months to find out what happens.</p>

<p>Damn you Stephen King, you and your awe-inspiring books.</p>

<p>But, back to reality, I can not recommend this book enough. Though, if you haven’t read the first five you need to hold off. I don’t think it would make as much sense or mean as much to someone that started with this one. That would be like starting the <u>Lord of the Rings</u> half-way through <u>The Two Towers</u>; it might still be good, but you’d have no clue what the hell was happening or why you’re supposed to care about any of the characters.</p>

<p>So let me say this: Even if you aren’t a fan of Stephen King (which I would actually not list myself as one) you really need to read these books. They are some of the best stories I’ve ever read, and the world(s) involved are so real you feel like you actually live there for the time it takes to read them.<br />

<p>You should read Frank Herbert's "Dune" series if you haven't already.  Great sci-fi material.  I haven't read all of them, nor have I read Brian Herbert's series about the same characters, but they always intrigue me when I go to the library.</p>

<p>The first book, Dune, was absolutely amazing. It seems like it didn't really kick in till about a hundred or so pages into it, but after that it was one of the best books I've ever read. Emperor and Children were pretty good as well, but I kind of lost interest after those...</p>

<p>Yes, after all the main characters I care about die, it's hard to see the need to read any more of the books.</p>
