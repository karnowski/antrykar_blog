<h3 class="title"><u>The Dispossessed</u> by <a href="http://www.ursulakleguin.com">Ursula K. LeGuin</a></h3>

<p>This is one of the best and most thought-provoking books I have read in ages. While it is a sci-fi novel about two sister planets, one ruled by an advanced version of our own society and the other a planet of anarchists, the book reads more like philosophy than anything else. Don't let that scare you, though. The story was excellent.</p>

<p>The planet of Anerres is a dry, dusty, arid planet and was unpopulated until citizens of Urras came to mine it for resources like gold and lead. While this was happening, another citizen of the planet of Urras, Odo, began to write and speak out about the virtues of a society where no one owns anything and power is non-existant. The movement her teachings sparked became so prominent and threatening to the governments on Urras that they bought them off with Anerres. The miners and other workers on the dry planet were brought home, and the Odonians (as they came to be known) were sent to establish a new society of their own, free from government, bosses, money, and class. <u>The Dispossessed</u> tells the story of a physicist named Shevek that lived one hundered and seventy-five years after that society began.</p>

<p>The story itself seemed to take a backseat to the ideas that run rampant throughout the text of this book. Thoughts about how a society based on anarchism would and would not work, as well as ideas that made you really take a look at the world around us pervaded each paragraph.</p>

<p>It's difficult to write about this book because there was simply <i>so much</i> going on that I find it hard to focus on any one thing. Last night, after I finished the last few words, I set the book down and immediately thought: <i>I'm going to have to read this again soon.</i> There was so much <i>depth</i> to the world and ideas conveyed that I honestly believe a single reading isn't enough to absorb it all.</p>

<p>Keep in mind (I can't stress this enough), this is not your average read and then put-on-the-shelf-and-never-think-about-again sci-fi novel. It was a true piece of literature, and I had a hard time (at first) believing that it was written by the same woman that wrote <u>A Wizard of Earthsea</u>. Not that there is anything wrong with <u>A Wizard...</u>, mind, I just wasn't expecting such an <i>adult</i> book.</p>

<p>So, I have to say, I loved it and plan on reading it again soon.</p>

<p>Tony, how did we grow up without reading Ursula?  I just can't figure it out.  I bought the _Wizard of Earthsea_ audiobook from Audible.com a couple of months ago and am about to start it.  (Just finished the _Ender's Game_ audio, I'm sure you understand.)</p>

<p>I really have no idea, but I've wondered about that a lot myself. With as much sci-fi and fantasy (not to mention just books in general) that we read, I find it hard to believe we never read her stuff. I seem to always remember having known her name, but never read her till recently.</p>

<p>It's weird, but at least we found her, though. Better late than never, as they say...</p>

<p>I can't believe I never made you read her stuff -I spent much of highschool trying to find all the sequals to "Wizard," and then trying to really understand them.  She's quite a feminist, which usually irks me to some degree, but her ideas about governing and being govered are thematic in all her stuff, and I like socialogy.  Check out the short story collection "A Fisherman of the Inland Sea."  There are two or three stories that stuck with me - I consider them revolutionary in the sense that my brain never could have imagined them.  Gotta give props to an author who can give you new eyes and still deliver a pretty good yarn.  </p>
