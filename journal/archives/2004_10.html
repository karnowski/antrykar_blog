<h3 class="title">Hobbits? For Real?</h3>

<p>This is very interesting. Scientists have unearthed a new species of human that they are referring to as "hobbits" because of their small stature. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3948165.stm">This is an article</a> on the BBC talking about the discovery. There are also some pictures of the skulls they found. <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/life/feature/story/0,13026,1337198,00.html">This one</a> is from the Guardian and is a bit more technical. </p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

<h3 class="title">One More Reason Not to Vote for Bush</h3>

<p>In case you needed it, <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2004/10/rfid_passports.html">here's</a> an article by Bruce Schneier about how Ashcroft's Home Land Security department is trying to invade our privacy, yet again.</p>

<h3 class="title">This Entry isn't Worth a Title...</h3>

<p>I need to be doing some homework, but I've decided to blog a bit instead. Not that I have anything all that pressing to say, mind you, I just feel like procrastinating.</p>

<p>This week has been move at such a slow rate of speed I’m starting think that time might actually reverse and I’ll have to relive it. Wouldn’t that suck?</p>

<p>I was talking with a friend the other day about the election, a topic that’s never far from my thoughts these days. He said something that I thought was bitingly relevant. Granted, it’s not a really new concept, but it still stands up to scrutiny. The comment was something along the lines of: </p>

<p><i>It kills me how people will stand by their political party and vote for a candidate that is obviously bad for our future just because of his affiliation. It’s like the political party is their favorite football team and they feel like they have to stand by them even through the times when they keep losing.</i></p>

<p>Only the practice of voting for someone just because he’s a Republican (or a Democrat, for that matter) is ludicrous. What if Hitler came back and ran under the GOP? How many people do you think would actually vote for him just because of the damned elephant?</p>

<p>It’s frightening.</p>

<p>Shouldn't our leaders be elected based on their plans for our future and their ability to carry out those plans? Am I wrong?</p>

<p>I don't know, but like I said earlier I don’t really have anything to say… I just felt like killing some time. Have fun and go vote (early voting is underway)!!!<br />

<h3 class="title">I Never Thought I'd do Something Like This</h3>

<p>But I am anyway.</p>

<p>Today is a big deadline for the Democratic party's fundraising. A few extra dollars could mean the difference in having to spend four more years under what is possibly the worst president to have been appointed.</p>

<p>If you have as little as $25 you can afford to put towards the election, please click <a href="https://www.democrats.org/support/kerry.html">here.</a> Don't think of it as giving money to John Kerry, if that helps. Think of it as a donation to the fight to save our environment. Or you can think of it as a donation to help fight the giant corporations that are taking over our world. You can even think of it as a donation to improve the quality of your own life. John Kerry has many plans that will take us out of this downward plunge that Bush has sent us in to, and I urge you to do all you can to help make his election a reality.</p>

<p>Our nation--hell, the <b>world</b>--can't take four more years of Bush.</p>

<h3 class="title">Success at Hastings</h3>

<p>I just got back from my first book signing, and I have a few things I have to say.</p>

<p>First of all I want to thank everyone at Hastings for all of their help in making this happen.</p>

<p>Secondly, I want to thank everyone else that made the day such a success.</p>

<p>Things kicked off around 4:00 (it was actually a little closer to 3:45, but whatever). I was really surprised by the turnout, and was even more shocked by the fact that the 20 copies that Hastings had ordered for the event sold out. I actually sold a couple of my own copies as well.</p>

<p>It was amazing! I met some really cool people (including a girl named Jessica that had a notepad full of questions and multiple sketches of some of the characters, all of which were awesome, by the way). I had so much fun I wish I was doing another one tomorrow!</p>

<p>I don't have anything else lined up at the moment, but I'll be sure to post the date and location as soon as I have one established.</p>

<p>Again, I want to thank everyone at Hastings and everyone else that made my first book signing such an amazing success!!!</p>

<h3 class="title">Early Voting Info for Blount County</h3>

<p>If any of you are interested in voting early (which I highly recommend) but don't know where or when to go, I've got your hook up right here.</p>

<p>Early voting will be held from Wednesday Oct. 13 to Thursday Oct. 28 at the Election Commission office on the first floor of the Blount County Courthouse. On weekdays, early voting will be held from 8:00am till 4:30pm. There will be two Saturdays when early voting will held, Oct. 16 and Oct 23. The times on Saturday are from 9:00am till 12 noon.</p>

<p>Granted, this information is only good if you live in Blount County. A quick google search should bring you the locations and times in your home town.</p>

<p>Everyone, please go vote! In my heart I hope that you vote for Kerry, just because I don't think our nation can survive four more years of Bush and his cronies, but I really don't care who you vote for, just so long as you vote.</p>

<p>Vive la democratie!!!</p>

<h3 class="title">The Vice-Presiential Debate</h3>

<p>There was quite a bit of mud-slinging last night between Senator Edwards and the current Vice-President. A lot of questioning of each other's credibility and their records, and I have a feeling we're going to see a lot about that over the next couple of days. But I also know that the most telling part of last night's debate will be glossed over in the media.</p>

<p>But not here, ladies and gentlemen. I mean to point out this shocking detail to you all in the hopes that we will all begin to see Dick Cheney for what he really is: a James Bond villain.</p>

<p>I know what you're thinking: "James Bond is just the imaginitive fiction of Ian Fleming. There are no real villains in that sense of the word."</p>

<p>Well, just let me beg to differ. The way he was holding himself (hunched over with his hands clasped before him, his eyebrows raising and lowering in unnatural arches, as if to say "This is my plotting face") told all we need to know. No normal person sits like that. No man or woman who isn't--at one level or another--trying to take over the world has that sort of posturing.</p>

<p>Am I wrong?</p>

<p>Now, I know you're thinking: "OK, where's your proof, then?" And to that, all I can say is that right now I'm operating on a hunch. However, I do plan on scouring the internet for any pictures or stories that will help my case. In the meantime, though, I ask that you keep the image of the mad scientist in mind as you watch the replays of Cheney in last night's debate. I assure you, you'll see what I'm talking about...</p>

<h3 class="title">Melvin Goes to Dinner</h3>

<p>Leslie and I watched <a href="http://www.melvingoestodinner.com/"><u>Melvin Goes to Dinner</u></a>, directed by <a href="http://www.bobanddavid.com/">Bob Odenkirk</a> of Mr. Show, last night. We got it from Netflix and, like many of the indie films we get through them, I had no idea what to expect from this movie.  It revolves around a dinner involving four people who know each other in varying degrees. Going into too much detail about that could be considered a spoiler, and I don't like being responsible for giving those out. Let me say, though, that this film really took me by surprise. The writing (dialogue) was brilliant, and the actors were totally convincing in their roles. I really cannot recommend this film enough. There were no real "hidden truths" revealed, but there were some pretty astounding comments on human nature throughout.</p>

<p>It was a relatively short film (only abot 80 minutes long) but there are so many discoveries it seems like it's longer. But that doesn't mean its boring. Quite the opposite, in fact. I was glued to the screen wnating to know what would happen next.</p>

<p>Oh, did I mention there are some great cameos by David Cross (also from Mr. Show) and Jack Black (do I really need to tell you who he is?)? Both were hilarious, though Black's was really, really, REALLY hilarious.</p>

<p>So, if you're looking for an intelligent movie with lots of great dialogue and absolutely no explosions or gunfire, this is the way to go. I know it's available through Netflix, but I'd almost say you should just buy it. It's one of those movies that will get better the more times its viewed.</p>

<p>Also, be sure to watch the "Franks Film Festival" short in the special features. You won't be disappointed.</p>
