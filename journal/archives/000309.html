<h3 class="title">Surveying my Goober Domain</h3>

<p>So yesterday evening was spent working in the yard. As Bill Hicks would put it: I was "surveying my goober domain." I'm not sure at what point I started caring about my yard, but the fact that I do scares me.</p>

<p>Granted, I don't care about it as much as, say, my <i>dad</i>, but I care enough to spread grass seed. Of course, in all fairness, the real reason I spread the grass seed is because my backyard (where the puppies play) has <i>no</i> grass at all. When it rains it becomes a giant mud pit and I can't let them out there. So, when it rains I have to take them out on the leashes, and that's a bit of a pain. I guess, then, the reason I put grass seed down is because I'm lazy and don't want to deal with the leashes. I'm bad, I know.</p>

<p>So the grass is cut, the edging complete, and the seed spread and covered with straw. I can now take a week, at least, off from my landscaping duties.</p>

<p>Leslie just called to say she dropped Petra off at the vet. We're having her fixed today. When we had Ender fixed I made Leslie take him; I just couldn't take my little buddy to have him cut. I knew it was for the best, but I couldn't bring myself to do it. This time, I do feel bad for her, but at the same time I really don't like the possibility of having a litter of puppies running around. God knows we barely have enough room as it is.</p>

<p>Well, I guess that about covers it for now. I may write more later, but we shall just have to wait and see.</p>
