<p>I'm not sure how many of you are aware of this, but the US Patriot Act, which was implemented after 9/11, has taken away several of our civil rights. One of these is the right to read whatever we want without the fear of our reading habits being monitored. Now, I don't know about you, but I really don't like the idea of this. Granted, I don't guess it will really matter if the CIA knows that I'm reading a lot of George R.R. Martin and Neil Gaiman, but what if I needed to check a "flagged" or "questionable" book out for research on a story I might be writing? or a paper for school? Should we really have our names flagged for checking out a book?</p>

<p>Don't get me wrong, I'm all about stopping terrorism, but I have said this for a long time, and I will continue to say it: if we give up our rights in order to stop terrorism we're giving the factions that use terrorist methods what they want. How can we stand by and let the government (well, the current administration, anyway) strip us of our rights in the name of protecting them?</p>

<p>I am a member of several on-line activist groups including <a href="http://www.moveon.org">MoveOn.org</a>. I believe that using the internet as a means of getting your beliefs and thoughts in front of your representatives is a wonderful thing, and I wish that everyone would get involved. It's amazingly easy, which (in my mind) means there's no excuse not to get involved.</p>

<p>But I digress. The whole point of this was to ask that anyone and everyone that believes we should have a right to read what we want without fear of having our choices tracked by the federal government should go <a href="http://www.readerprivacy.com/">here</a> and sign this online petition. We don't have a whole lot of time (only about two weeks) before they take this before Congress, so please give it a look.</p>

<p>If it seems like something you can get behind, sign it and then ask other people you believe would be interested to take a look as well. We have to defend our rights or we'll lose them. We're already on a 1984-ish path as it is (what with the never-ending war on terror), and I want to keep it from getting any worse.</p>

<p>I hope you do, too.</p>

<p>Cool, hon.</p>

<p>Though the flagging of books was around long before the Patriot Act. It's just that the Patriot Act opened up a lot of agencies' rights to use that information that was not previously allowed. Remember that scene in "Seven"?</p>

<p>The electronic data boards above the highways here still broadcast the Operation TIPS number. "To report suspicious activity, call 1 800 xxx xxxx".</p>

<p>Big Brother is watching.</p>

<p>Yeah, I should have been more specific about that. It just gives the agencies the right to USE the information. I wish there was some way to keep them from tracking the info at all, but I'd rather them be able to see it and not use it than the alternative...</p>

<p>BTW, did you sign the petition?</p>

<p>Also, that TIPS stuff was scary. That whole thing was straight out of Orwell...<br />

<p>Yeah, I signed it. 'Course, I'm already on their lists... checked out a few copies of Dante's 'Inferno' and the Anarchist Cookbook in my days, have I.</p>
