<h3 class="title">Sundown with Bela</h3>

<p>So, the fates pushed me toward Sundown in the City last night, where I watched Bela Fleck and the Flecktones. It was a pretty decent show, although they have become a little too schmultzy for me. (If you don't know what schmultz is, listen to Kenny G. He's the KING of schmultz.)</p>

<p>Anyway, the most exciting part of the show was running into some people I hadn't seen in years. That's a good and bad thing about Knoxville. It's a big enough city that you get all the inconveniences (traffic, large crowds) but too small to become truly anonymous. Out of the thirty people I ran into, I was glad to see maybe five of them.</p>

<p>I also discovered (well, rediscovered actually) how anti-social I really am. I enjoy talking to people in small groups, but when I get in a large group of people like that I start getting really, really, really angry. It's not agorophobia. I know that because I'm not <i>afraid</i> of the people or the open, public places. They just piss me off. I can't even really say what it is about them that gets me so riled up, either. Just the fact that they exist is sometimes enough for me. I mean, I love people on individual bases; I just hate the public.</p>

<p>Oh well, no need to continue that rant. I guess I can go ahead and sum up:</p>

<p>Bela Fleck was pretty cool, I hate the public, and I didn't smoke at all while I was there. There were a few moments of temptation, but I was strong.</p>

<p>Anyway... that's all I have right now...</p>
