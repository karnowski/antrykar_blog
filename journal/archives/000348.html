<h3 class="title">Fake Plastic Trees</h3>

<p>Her green plastic watering can<br />
For her fake chinese rubber plant<br />
In fake plastic earth.<br />
That she bought from a rubber man<br />
In a town full of rubber plants<br />
Just to get rid of itself.<br />
And it wears her out, it wears her out<br />
It wears her out, it wears her out.</p>

<p>She lives with a broken man<br />
A cracked polystyrene man<br />
Who just crumbles and burns.<br />
He used to do surgery<br />
For girls in the eighties<br />
But gravity always wins.<br />
And it wears him out, it wears him out<br />
It wears him out, it wears him out.</p>

<p>She looks like the real thing<br />
She tastes like the real thing<br />
My fake plastic love.<br />
But I can’t help the feeling<br />
I could blow through the ceiling<br />
If I just turn and run<br />
And it wears me out, it wears me out<br />
It wears me out, it wears me out.</p>

<p>And if I could be who you wanted<br />
If I could be who you wanted,<br />
All the time, all the time, ohhh... ohh...</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/r/radiohead/113257.html">Source of the lyrics.</a></p>

<p>I'm pretty sure I've raved about Radiohead on this thing before somewhere, but they're so good I feel it bears repeating. Out of all the other bands alive and active at this time, Radiohead is in the top 3, easy. This song, while being fairly old, still has the power to stir emotion in me. Hell, the whole album (<i>The Bends</i>) is amazing. </p>

<p>The lines:<br />
He used to do surgery<br />
For girls in the eighties<br />
But Gravity always wins<br />
It wears him out...</p>

<p>just kill me. Old Thom Yorke has talent with words. While that may not strike many as profound, it speaks volumes to me. And, I have no doubt, those volumes were never intended by Mr. Yorke and Co.</p>

<p>I really don't know where I'm going with this. I as just listening to this album and felt like I had to post something about it.</p>
