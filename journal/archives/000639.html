<h3 class="title">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince by J.K. Rowling</h3>

<p><b>****WARNING SPOILERS****</b></p>

<p><b>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</b>, the sixth in the series by J.K. Rowling, was no disappointment. Rowling’s prose has, again, grown with her protagonist, becoming more complex and darker with each new volume. In a series that has been renowned as one of the greatest in the realm of children’s literature, Rowling is having no trouble keeping her adult audience riveted as well.</p>

<p>The story is far darker than any we’ve seen so far, while also giving us far more insight into some of the characters we’ve known since <b>The Sorcerer’s Stone</b>. Be wary, from here on out there will be some definite spoilers.</p>

<p><b>**** I'm serious. There are some major spoilers here, turn back now if you haven't read the book and don't want it ruined for you. ****</b></p>

<p>The biggest shock, other than the death of the greatest Headmaster ever to grace Hogwart’s, was the developments in Snape’s character. While I can’t pretend that I hadn’t suspected Professor Snape was a traitor, I never once suspected that he would be the one to kill Dumbledore. In fact, despite many conversations, I wasn’t sure that Dumbledore would even be the one to die.</p>

<p>Another great disappointment was seeing Harry finally hook up with Ginny, only to break up with her almost immediately after. Though, I suspect she won’t let that stand. Ginny is a very strong character, and I can’t see her staying at home while Harry, Ron, and Hermione leave to track down the pieces of Voldemort’s soul that are scattered across the world. I would be very surprised if she doesn’t accompany them, regardless of what Molly Weasley has to say about it.</p>

<p>All in all, despite the sickness in my stomach from all of the tragedy that came in this story, this was a brilliant work of fiction. The only real complaint I have is that I now have to wait an undetermined amount of time before the next—and last—installment of the Harry Potter series.</p>
