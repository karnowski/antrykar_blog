<h3 class="title">Gig This Saturday</h3>

<p>This Saturday, April 9th, Ron and I will be playing at AJ's in Maryville with Blue Revolution, a blues-based jam band. We're set to go on around 9 and will be playing till about 1 in the morning. I haven't been to AJ's yet, so I can't vouch for the quality of the establishment, but I know the musicians we're playing with are top-notch. If you find yourself in Maryville looking for some good music this Saturday, stop in and check it out!</p>

<p>There's not too much more to report right now. I'm still waiting to hear back from a couple of places I've submitted to, but as soon as I know something I'll report it here.</p>

<p>I've changed the name of the <u>Forgotten Prophecies</u> sequel again. It's not too different, but it's now called <u>Path of Darkness</u>. I'm about 2/5 of the way through the second draft and it's coming along nicely.</p>

<p>Anyway, that's all for now. Take care!</p>
