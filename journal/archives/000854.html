<h3 class="title">Bush Spying on Americans</h3>

<p>Sorry, but I have to rant for a moment…</p>

<p>I’m sure most of you have read or heard by now that our President has been spying on Americans. To hear him and his supporters tell it, he is doing only what is necessary to keep us safe during a time of war. Now, I have to ask, does this mean the war in Iraq that was supposed to be “accomplished” more than two years ago, or the never-ending “War on Terror?”</p>

<p>This is an important question. If it has to do with the Iraq war, then why are we spying on Americans? Are the actions of our citizens here at home actually doing anything to help those forces that are still engaged in combat with our troops abroad? Does monitoring our phone calls in any way make our troops safer? I suppose it’s possible, but it just seems very unlikely to me that any phone conversation an ordinary citizen might be having with someone overseas could in any way hinder our troops’ performance or endanger their safety. If Bush really wants to keep our soldiers safe, why doesn’t he bring them home?</p>

<p>So, then, it must be meant that because of the “War on Terror” he has to have us monitored. Right? Let’s examine this for a minute. First, how in the world can you possibly be at war with terror? Or even terrorism? Last time I checked terror was – depending on how you want to define it – either an emotion or a concept. Terrorism, on the other hand, is merely a tactic used by certain political factions to disrupt and frighten. How can you wage war on either of these?</p>

<p>Is it not more correct to think that this “War on Terror” is nothing more than a political strategy used by the Bush Administration (and let’s not forget Fox News) to keep people scared and in the frame of mind that we need to be protected? Doesn’t this make it easier for Bush to justify more military spending? What about this unwarranted surveillance? Doesn’t having a “War” on Terror make it easy to justify that, too?</p>

<p>So, really, isn’t it just that the Bush Administration wants to be the foremost power in the world? Isn’t it just that they want us to believe we’re in a never-ending war so they can continue to oppress our civil liberties and give more money to the already super rich?</p>

<p>Shouldn’t we insist that our political leaders start speaking to us in terminology that actually means something instead of using all of this double-speak? Am I alone in this?</p>

<p>All is meant in the friendliest debate possibly and not blasting anyone’s thoughts or beliefs.<br />
War on terror is what I would think. I know you are going to find it a big surprise but I think spying on Americans is not right but do see where spying on phone calls in America could be beneficial. I would think the listening is not just done arbitrarily and someone has some type of suspicion as to what calls are being listened. I can honestly say I would not be pissed if I was trying to do something that would jeopardize my country and was found I because I was moronic enough to do so where I could be heard. <br />
Why is it that this war in Iraq is hated so much and no one got up in arms when clinton sent forces to more than half a dozen different countries for the same reasons Bush has sent forces to Iraq? I am not in total support of the United States of America being world police but solely support our troops.<br />
I am surprised more of the left side is not in support of us helping the poor and less fortunate and feel it is why I do not necessarily support us being world support since I have the mentality of it is so bad else where do what you have to make it better. The United States of America is the GREATEST place to live and everyone else is pissed because they can not be us. I know we differ on who should support and take care of each other (some say the country should take care of everyone and others say we should take care of ourselves).<br />
Hope to see you on 12/23, again this is not meant to be mean and hateful.</p>

<p>NOTHING BUT LOVE FOR YOU.</p>

<p>Sorry about the repost, I hit post before spell check and was typing and working at the same time and moronically misspelled too many words (including mornic).</p>

<p>First of all, good to hear from you, Voodoomood.</p>

<p>All right (in the spirit of debate), let me say first that I do think America is a pretty decent place to live. I can't say it's the GREATEST place to live, simply because I've never lived in another country and don't have any experiences to compare it with.</p>

<p>I agree, to a point, that it's okay to monitor SOME phone calls as long as the people being monitored have actually been investigated and have some real possibility of being a threat to anyone, regardless of their national affiliation. However, as we have seen with many of the people that were captured and detained after the 9/11 attacks, the Bush administration has a nasty tendency to detain (or spy upon, whichever the case may be) people that have no ties to any terrorist organization whatsoever. They have a "shoot now, ask questions later" mentality that is doing nothing to improve anyone's situation in the world, except big oil companies.</p>

<p>Which brings me to this: What I have against this war (I can't speak for anyone else) is that it was sold to the American people with false information and for reasons that were benevolent only to large oil companies. (Is anyone else noticing a pattern here?) There was never any thought given to actually helping the Iraqi people until Bush and Friends needed something that sounded warm and fuzzy to help sell it to the masses.</p>

<p>Ah, I do love a good debate...</p>

<p>I wonder what an 'ordinary citizen' is. Am I one? I hope not.</p>

<p>Where do you draw the line? What if protecting the liberties of the majority causes a few to die? Was it worth it? Is the personal freedom that sweet?</p>

<p>Can you take it too far? Most definitely. Has it already been taken too far? Maybe.</p>

<p>It's not such an easy issue to be one just one side of, at least not for me.</p>

<p>If I buy a coat for a homeless person mostly to make myself look good, and only a little for the cold person, does that make them any less warm? I'm rambling badly now, but you get the idea.</p>

<p>All good points and seems that most have some type of supports and disagreements on both sides.</p>

<p>Again if you do not want to get caught doing something illegal, do not do it.  I personally would not have a problem with someone listening to my conversations, but I would have a problem with being detained or questions for my beliefs or feelings that are not breaking any laws.</p>

<p>Still, even if you aren't doing anything wrong, we expect a certain level of privacy here in the States. If we are subject to the government's monitoring, are we really free at that point? Freedom - to me at least - is knowing that you are free to do whatever you want so long as you don't infringe on another person's rights. This includes the idea that you aren't being watched while you do it. I could understand - though I doubt I would still agree with - the need to monitor people that have been known accomplices of certain terrorist organizations, but the Bush administration has been monitoring EVERYONE. There has been quite a bit of evidence come out over the past few weeks showing that they are basically just data-farming.</p>

<p>The real issue here, though, is that Bush authorized these wiretaps illegally. There is a court set up that allows for wiretaps - even retroactively - and they've only ever denied 4 (I think) requests. That's out of over 19,000. The real issue here is that Bush and Co. have decided they are above the law. Nixon thought the same thing. Unless we as citizens stand up and demand accountability for our leaders we'll find ourselves living in an authoritarian dictatorship before long.</p>

<p>And no, I don't think I'm over-reacting.</p>

<p>I, oddly enough, agree with most of what you are saying.</p>

<p>If we are doing something illegal, whether it is infringing on someone’s rights or not it is still against the law.  I know there is a fine line there.  I do not know where I stand on the "secret police" that have been created by Homeland Security.  I know we need stepped up measures to insure our safety but not need to sacrifice our freedom.</p>

<p>Tough call sometimes.</p>

<p>I feel the same.</p>

<p>Do I want people I don't know listening to my phone conversations? No.</p>

<p>Would I be in favor of it if those acts (as a whole) led to the prevention of something bad happening, done by someone no one had a reason to suspect? Yes.</p>

<p>Stupid gray areas.</p>

<p>I think there are far better ways to keep ourselves safe. The Bushies have been using 9/11 and the threat of terrorism as a blanket to cover everything they want to do. They know that what they're doing isn't right, which is why they have to hide behind something that has a lot of people scared (and I don't just mean religion). I am not all right with having my phone calls or emails monitored when they still have done nothing to patch the holes in security around our own borders or in our nuclear power stations. Those are things that - if they truly cared about our safety - should have been top priority. SO why is it more than four years later they still haven't been addressed?</p>
