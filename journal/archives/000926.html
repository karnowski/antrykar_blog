<h3 class="title">Ah, the Nth Tea...</h3>

<p>I started writing this yesterday morning, but got side-tracked and am having to finish it now.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.stellarcon.org">Stellarcon</a> was a huge success. I met some really great people (too many to name individuals), and had a really great time in the process. Everyone was super-cool, and I even managed to make it through all of my panels without making an ass out of myself. At least, I think so, anyway.</p>

<p>Saturday night, after pretty much everything was wrapped up, I found myself at a party hosted by Michael Pederson of <a href="http://www.nthzine.com">Nth Degree</a>. I was told that it was to be <b>the</b> party of the Con, and I think that was a fair estimation. Two rooms were taken over for the affair, and people were still spilling out into the halls. It was great. One of the highlights of that party was the Nth Tea. This, for those of you that don't know, is a special mix of chi tea and about seven different types of liquor concocted by Michael himself. All I know is that halfway through my first cup, I was doing quite well. The coolest thing about it, though, was that it tasted great! It was one of those horribly-dangerous, alcoholic beverages that allow you to lose track of yourself quite easily. I managed to pace myself, though, and I was thankful for that yesterday morning.</p>

<p>Other con highlights: There are almost too many. Meeting Timothy Zahn at the ConCarolinas party Friday night was great, and getting to appear beside him on the Star Wars Episode III panel was even better. Everyone on that panel was great, though. Actually, all the panelists I was with were fantastic, now that I think about it.</p>

<p>The first one I did was called "Should you go there" or something similar, and was about the Dark Side of writing. Tee Morris, Tony Ruggierio, Jana Oliver, and Shawn Reynolds were on that panel with me, and they were fabulous! I don't think I could have made it through without them.</p>

<p>I would love to include every cool thing that happened at the con, but I think that post would end up taking the rest of the day to write, so I think I'll have to stop there.</p>

<p>You didn't make an ass out of yourself as far as I noticed, at least not at the "don't go there" panel.  I enjoyed meeting you and looking forward to getting into your books.</p>

<p>I told you that drink was a dangerous one. But for some reason I swear I remember it tasting slightly of apples, not tea...</p>

<p>Yay for pseudonymns and identity preservation!</p>

<p>Thanks, Shane, I appreciate that. That particular panel was a lot of fun, and I found it to be surprisingly deep for my first panel. There seemed to be a lot of soul-baring on behalf of some of the panelists (and some of the attendees, too) which made for a great discussion.</p>

<p>As far as the Nth Tea goes, I can see how it had a subtle apple flavor to it, but it was definitely a spicier sort of apple flavor. But to me it was more like a green tea - a little bit of a bite, but still refreshing. It was damn good however you want to look at it, though.</p>

<p>So how did the Lucas panel go? Anyone actually defending the poor guy?</p>

<p>Well, the big thing I heard wasn't so much a defense as much as saying he screwed up by catering to the fans too much. I tend to agree with this. It was like he wanted to make the fans happy by tying all the threads off from the first trilogy, but the overall story suffered because of it...</p>

<p>So, no, I don't know that anyone actually defended him. There seemed to be quite a bit of discontent with the film overall. It was a realy fun panel, though.</p>

<p>     Hey, I know it's been quite a while since the con, but I'd just like to say that I've been kicking myself since then because I didn't buy your books.  Especially since my boyfriend said that they were very good.  I believe he said something like, "you could see his writing getting better as the book went on, then he plateaued at a level that usually takes authors a few books to get to...."  He won't let me borrow the books, he's all protective of them....grrr.<br />
     I meant to buy a least your first book, but I went to the Raven Mimura thing, and the dealer room was closed when I got out, and, alas, you were gone the next day.  And let me tell you, I cried into the bookmark thingy for days.....<br />
     Well, anyway, I'm sure I'm going to get my hands on your books soon.  I look forward to it!</p>

<p>Thanks, Lea. Tell Zac I said thanks for the kind words, and he should let you borrow the books. It won't hurt my feelings. If I'd had to buy every book I've ever read, I would be very, very, very broke.</p>

<p>AHH! You used my name! Ah! My anonymity, dashed to bits!</p>

<p>Eh whatever. Not like anyone's gonna kill me. But Anthony, you don't know what it's like man. She has this thing with folding books on their spine when she reads them. Desecration, I say! I let her borrow books, but only my non-autographed ones.</p>
<span class="comments-post">Posted by: Angelo at March  1, 2006  2:23 PM</span>

<div class="comments-body">
<p>Sorry Za... I mean Angelo. I'll make sure not to make the same mistake again.</p>

<p>I didn't realize you were a book mangler, Lea. In most situations I don't mind seeing a beat-up copy of a book. That usually just means it's actually been read, which is what books are for, ultimately. But I can understand the hesitation to loan out autographed copies to known book-manglers.</p>

<p>     Hey, I was good to your's and Lane's "Dark Tower" books when I was allowed to borrow them.  And I treated your "Coldfire" books reasonably well, considering we were in 10th grade and I had never tried to not put marks on the spine before.  <br />
     Well, anyway, what you guys call "mangled" I call "well-loved!"  You should see my "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone."  It's all creased and taped and there is a corner missing, and I love it to death!  But I do understand the thing about autographed copies and me getting my hands on them....  Oh well, I guess I'll have to dish out a few bucks.  Eh, no problem.</p>

<p>       Toodles,<br />
