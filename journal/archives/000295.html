<h3 class="title">Should this be Allowed?</h3>

<p>All right. First of all go <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/LAW/04/05/scotus.drug.dogs.ap/index.html">here</a> and read this article. Once you're done, come back to read my rant...</p>

<p>First and foremost I want to point out that the guy in question here was pulled over for driving six (6) miles over the speed limit. Six miles!!! Who here has <i>never</i> driven six miles over the limit? That's right! No one. We are all guilty of this at one point of our lives or another.</p>

<p>Now, if the guy was driving around with some type of controlled substance in his car, he should have been watching the speedometer a little closer. He was obviously being careless, but that's beside the point right now. The true question is: Should the fuzz be allowed to "sniff" our cars with a drug dog just for speeding?</p>

<p>I'm sure some people right now are thinking: "Well, I wouldn't mind, because I never have illicit drugs in my car." While that is a semi-valid point, you have to consider the fact that it is <i>still</i> and invasion of privacy. </p>

<p><i>Hmmm,</i> thought the over-weight officer as he scratched his mustache. <i> This kid was only over the limit by four miles, but he DOES have a Grateful Dead sticker on the back of his car, and he's got long hair. I better call Ronnie over so he can bring the dog.</i></p>

<p>Maybe I shouldn't care about this, as I do make it a practice to never drive around with illegal substances in my possession, but it still kind of pisses me off. It's just one step closer to Ashcroft's wet dream of no personal rights at all. I could understand them bringing the dogs in if there was smoke pouring out the windows, but just because a guy is acting a little nervous? Hell, <i>every</i>time I've ever been pulled over I was nervous...</p>

<p>I don't know... I just had to vent...</p>

<p>Maybe he had a car like my ol' Taurus.  I was coming home from Nashville with a friend and got pulled over doing 7 miles over.  He asked us to step out of the car because he needed to search it.  Of course, if you've seen that poor car, you may understand his concern, but still.  It sucked.  Anyhow, he admitted that he didn't believe that I would have drugs.  It was just that the car looked, and I quote, "suspicious".  I was pulled over 3 times in one week for the same reason before I decided to give in and get a new car.  Geez.</p>

<p>BTW, I wouldn't suggest carrying forceps (sp) in the car...I used them to adjust the heating and air (yes, the car was that bad off) and to say the least, officer man was a little concerned.</p>

<p>Seth and I got pulled over several years back when he and Kip lived together.  He was taking me home later in the evening and a cop pulled his Honda over for a tail light out.  The cop called for three other cruisers to show up (why?) and had us go back to one of the other cars where one guy watched us while the rest of them searched the car... throwing clean laundry, digging through fast food bags of trash.  I had a bag of bathroom cleaners and rags (from my efforts at the bachelor pad) and they asked what they were for.  We got the third degree before they let us go.  And then my parents were pissed cus I was late for curfew.  Now, was that really necessary?</p>

<p>O.K. Tiffy in your case the office had no PC to search. He could ask for a consential search in which you state the boundaries of the search and he must follow them. You may have terminated the search at any time. The only time an officer has PC to perform a search of you vehicle is when you are detained then he can only search the area that the person detained would have had immediate access to. With the case stated in the article the dog does not constitute a search it falls under the right for space clause. Meaning the dog had a right to be there. However you cannot be arrested if the dog smells something the office cannot find.</p>

<p>Well, that's good to know now!  Of course, even if I knew it, I doubt I would've thought about it.  That was the first time I had ever been pulled over :(  I was skeered...</p>
