<p>Well, things are coming along nicely. We've got the brunt of the site up, but it's still not done. The links to the left work now, though you'll notice a few oddities on the different pages. Mainly subtle differences in page width/height, but those should be taken care of soon. The Characters page has Jamis listed twice, which should be fixed pretty soon, too--hopefully in the next day or so.</p>

<p>I want to thank both of the Trotters (Jason and Mark) for helping me out with all this stuff. Without Jason there wouldn't be any other pages, and without Mark I would have crappy little sketches of the characters that wouldn't be worth looking at. They're both extremely talented, and I'm happy to have them as friends.</p>

<p>I also want to thank Larry for letting me host the site on his server. He's a great brother, and he takes way better care of me than I deserve.</p>

<p>Let's see... what else? There are still plenty of pages that have to be fine-tuned, but I'm very pleased with the way things are coming. Hopefully it will all be finished before too long.</p>

<p>I'm rapidly approaching the 86,000 word mark on <i>The Crystal Skull</i>. That's a bit of a milestone to me, since <i>Forgotten Prophecies</i> was just over 86,000 words. I still don't think it's going to be finished anytime soon, but I did just have a break-through on part of the story, so I expect things to start going a little more quickly now. I have to say, though, I'm already dreading the editing process. I know there's going to be a lot I'll have to rework in one fashion or another.</p>

<p>The bookmarks I ordered for <i>Forgotten Prophecies</i> should be in today, finally. I plan on placing them in most (if not all) of the bookstores here locally. I hope they'll help generate interest in the book and the website.</p>

<p>Anyway, I think that's about all I have for now. I'll let you all know as more updates happen.</p>
