<h3 class="title">Hoping today is a little better...</h3>

<p>Yesterday was one of those days everyone wishes wouldn't happen. I woke up in a bad mood only to find out that my schedule for this semester had been canceled. Somehow they screwed up my financial aid, but I got everything taken care of. I lost one of my classes because it was closed when I went to reregister. However, I signed up for another that will take the place of the two phys-ed classes I have to take. Because of this (can someone say silver-lining?) I will actually be finished this summer instead of this Christmas! Woo-hoo!</p>

<p>Finishing up <i>Passage of Darkness</i> is probably going to take a while. Not just because of school, but also because of its sheer size. I'm actually dreading it a bit. I did go ahead and start on another book called <i>Cameron and the Grem</i>, which will be a relatively short childrens/young adult book. I've already got a good start; I'm half-way through chapter three, and there will only be eight! I'm going to try and bust my ass this week and hope I can get the majority of it written before I go back to school next week. I'll be really surprised if I actually get finished, but it would be nice to have three-quarters of it done. At the rate I'm writing, I think that's a fairly attainable goal.</p>

<p>Anyway, I went off caffeine yesterday, which I think added to my condition of irrationality. I'm trying to stay away from it, but it'll be tough to continue when school starts back. Oh well, I'll just have to really watch myself.</p>

<p>That's it, nothing else to report right now...</p>
