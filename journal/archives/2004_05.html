<h3 class="title">Fake Plastic Trees</h3>

<p>Her green plastic watering can<br />
For her fake chinese rubber plant<br />
In fake plastic earth.<br />
That she bought from a rubber man<br />
In a town full of rubber plants<br />
Just to get rid of itself.<br />
And it wears her out, it wears her out<br />
It wears her out, it wears her out.</p>

<p>She lives with a broken man<br />
A cracked polystyrene man<br />
Who just crumbles and burns.<br />
He used to do surgery<br />
For girls in the eighties<br />
But gravity always wins.<br />
And it wears him out, it wears him out<br />
It wears him out, it wears him out.</p>

<p>She looks like the real thing<br />
She tastes like the real thing<br />
My fake plastic love.<br />
But I can’t help the feeling<br />
I could blow through the ceiling<br />
If I just turn and run<br />
And it wears me out, it wears me out<br />
It wears me out, it wears me out.</p>

<p>And if I could be who you wanted<br />
If I could be who you wanted,<br />
All the time, all the time, ohhh... ohh...</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/r/radiohead/113257.html">Source of the lyrics.</a></p>

<p>I'm pretty sure I've raved about Radiohead on this thing before somewhere, but they're so good I feel it bears repeating. Out of all the other bands alive and active at this time, Radiohead is in the top 3, easy. This song, while being fairly old, still has the power to stir emotion in me. Hell, the whole album (<i>The Bends</i>) is amazing. </p>

<p>The lines:<br />
He used to do surgery<br />
For girls in the eighties<br />
But Gravity always wins<br />
It wears him out...</p>

<p>just kill me. Old Thom Yorke has talent with words. While that may not strike many as profound, it speaks volumes to me. And, I have no doubt, those volumes were never intended by Mr. Yorke and Co.</p>

<p>I really don't know where I'm going with this. I as just listening to this album and felt like I had to post something about it.</p>

<h3 class="title">One more for Citizen X</h3>

<p>Our new manager, Zac, delivered 10 copies (5 each) to both the Disc Exchange locations in K-town. The West store has a copy on their listening bar somewhere. I'm not sure if it will be with the Local's Section (which is where the CD can be found) or somewhere else, but I'm sure the friendly staff can point you in the direction if you want to give it a listen.</p>

<p>It's going to be hard to get a buzz going about us since we don't really have a band (it's just me and Ron), so I need to ask all of you that have heard it to <b>PLEASE</b> pass the word about us. The album is very eclectic, and has something for everyone.</p>

<p>If anyone asks what it sounds like, I always tell them it's the musical equivalent of mutant zombies dancing beneath a flame-ridden sky.</p>

<p>It always raises eyebrows, and has actually inspired a couple of people to find out exactly what that sounds like.</p>

<p>Anyway. Thanks everyone for any help you may (and/or have) give(n).</p>

<h3 class="title">Citizen X Merchandise</h3>

<p>The musical outfit that I make up half of, <a href="http://www.citizenxensemble.com">Citizen X</a>, now has a couple of t-shirts and stickers available through <a href="http://cafepress.com">Cafe Press</a>. You can see our shopfront <a href="http://www.cafeshops.com/citizenxshop">here</a>.</p>

<p>There aren't too many to choose from at the moment, but I will be adding more designs as time goes by.</p>

<p>I should, hopefully, have shirts and other merchandise featuring characters from my new novel, <u>Forgotten Prophecies</u>, before too much longer. My good friend Mark Trotter is currently working on the art. He's an amazing artist, and I know that anything he comes up with will be top-notch.</p>

<p>As far as when the novel will be out, I still don't have a firm date, but I received the digital proofs from my editor last Friday. In the message I wa told that I can expect to see it in print in no longer than 3 months. That's going to give us a possible release date of late August, early September. I'll be sure to keep everyone up-to-date.</p>

<h3 class="title">I Wanna Stay Home</h3>

<p>When you need someone<br />
And there's no one there<br />
There is always the nine o'clock<br />
To take you out somewhere</p>

<p>I take the train in town<br />
Like I did for years<br />
There is only seven more blocks<br />
I could walk from here</p>

<p>I wanna stay home<br />
I wanna stay home right here<br />
I wanna stay home today<br />
I wanna stay</p>

<p>It's only six o'clock<br />
When my day begins<br />
There is always my alarm clock<br />
To wake me up again</p>

<p>I wanna stay home<br />
I wanna stay home right here<br />
I wanna stay home today<br />
I wanna stay</p>

<p>When I realize the weight<br />
That's firmly on my shoulders (on my shoulders)<br />
I just try and find a place<br />
I can take a walk on my blind side (on my blind side)</p>

<p>When these memories fade<br />
In my ripe old age<br />
Please remember my dear</p>

<p>I wanna stay home<br />
I wanna stay home right here<br />
I wanna stay home today<br />
I wanna stay...</p>

<p>I wanna stay...</p>

<p>This song by the Jellyfish (I know, <b>again</b> with the Jellyfish..) sums up the past few days for me. Work has been a little more annoying than usual, and I just wish I could work out of the house.</p>

<p>Oh well... One day.</p>

<p>The song is brilliant. The only problem I have with it is the annoying trumpet part throughout. Now, I would be fine with it--would even <b>love</b> it, in fact--if it wasn't so obviously played on late 80's synthesizer. I mean, here in the aughts, we still don't have good horn sounds on synths. They were even worse back in the day.</p>

<p>Again, oh well...</p>

<p>So Citizen X has restocked <a href="http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/citizenx">cdbaby.com</a> with albums, so everyone please buy one! We should have albums in both Disc Exchange locations later this week, and we're always available for download on the iTunes Music Store and the New Napster.</p>

<p>Tell all your friends! </p>

<h3 class="title">David Bowie in Atlanta</h3>

<p>Saturday night Leslie and I went to Chastain Park Amphitheatre in Atlanta to see <a href="http://www.davidbowie.com">David Bowie</a> play. The venue was one of the nicest I've ever attended, but had a very controlled, almost oppressed, air. There were more staff and police officers present than I have ever seen at a concert--except maybe Lollapalooza, although I don't recall a <i>real</i> heavy police presence there, either. But overall, the venue was pretty well-run and beautiful.</p>

<p>A band called <a href="http://www.stereophonics.com/stereophonics.html">Stereophonics</a> opened up and put on a pretty good show. I was unfamiliar with their work going in, so I probably didn't enjoy it as much as I could have. They had a post-pop feel, with plenty of talent and musicianship displayed. I plan on checking out some of their studio work soon.</p>

<p>Bowie - What can I say, really, that hasn't probably already been said? The man is a genius, and he has the ability to put together a really great band. Every one of the musicians on that stage played beautifully, with only one mistake that I picked up on through out the whole show. And, let me stress, that one mistake was <i>tiny</i>. The show was a pretty good mix of old and new songs. Going in I was a little concerned that it would be only new material, but when he opened with "Rebel, Rebel" those concerns melted away. I would have liked to have heard more from the <i>Earthling</i> and <i>Outside</i> periods, but he did play some of the best songs from both of those albums, including "I'm Afraid of Americans," which I thought was a little brave considering the crowd.</p>

<p>I was amazed by the number of white-collar conservative types at the show. I'm sorry, but I had to say it. It was just surprising to me to be at a show where I had expected the seats to be filled with goths and other assorted weirdos, and find them, instead, occupied by people decked out in 80's attire or looking like they just walked off the golf course. Not that there weren't a few freaks mixed in with the bunch. There were several people gothed or ziggyed out for the show.</p>

<p>All in all, it was an experience. I'm not sure it was worth the ticket price plus the drive, but I am glad I got to see him play. That's just one more thing I can scratch off the list...</p>

<h3 class="title">She Still Loves Him</h3>

<p>He writes her a letter<br />
Tells her he won't be lonesome - she still loves him<br />
He lost his temper<br />
And belted his love 'cross the room - she still loves him</p>

<p>Drinks when he's sad<br />
Gets happy then mad at the world - she still loves him<br />
Never remembers<br />
That day in September when wed - she still loves him</p>

<p>So she recalls the days when they were younger<br />
Flowers could heal her wounds<br />
But now those days are long since gone forever<br />
Now her pain just fills every room</p>

<p>Faces aglow<br />
As the light from the T.V. show just separates them now - she still loves him<br />
All they wanted to be<br />
Was as happy as couple #3 on their favorite game show - she still loves him</p>

<p>He recalls the days when they were younger<br />
The future could heal their wounds<br />
But now those days are long since gone forever<br />
Now her pain just fills every room</p>

<p>I know someday this will all work out<br />
She'll never face this alone<br />
The light in her eyes may be flickering dim<br />
But she still loves him</p>

<p>This song was written by Andrew Sturmer for the Jellyfish, quite possibly the world's most under-rated band ever. The song appears on <u>Bellybutton</u>, their first album, which was released in 1990. The album sold well, had a few hits on the college charts, and they were expected to go on to do great things. Their second album, <u>Spilt Milk</u>, is unbelievable. It is a masterpiece that never got the recognition it deserves because the record label didn't put enough into the marketing. Because of this lack of label support, the album didn't sale well, and I'll never get to have a new Jellyfish album to listen to.</p>

<p>It's a travesty.</p>
