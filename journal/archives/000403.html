<h3 class="title">The Library and Neil Gaiman</h3>

<p>As I was dropping off my stack of library books last night (don't you just love the library? All those books for free, as long as you bring them back on time. What a wonderful invention...), I decided to donate a copy of Forgotten Prophecies. The woman behind the counter seemed really excited by the prospect, and gladly took it to be entered into their circulation. I have no idea how long it will take to actually be available, but if you really want to read it and can't swing the cover price, check it out from the Blount County Library. I plan on donating one to the Knox County as well, but I haven't had a chance yet.</p>

<p>As a shot in the dark I sent a message to <a href="http://www.neilgaiman.com">Mr. Neil Gaiman</a>, one of my favorite writers of all time. He's responsible for giving us the DC Comics' Sandman tales as well as several great novels (<u>American Gods</u> and <u>Neverwhere</u> are my two favorites). Well, I asked if he would be interested in receiving a copy of my novel, and--believe it or not--I got an email yesterday from the Fabulous Lorraine, his personal assistant. (And let me tell you, she <i><b>is</i></b> fabulous. Not only is she beautiful, but she's in a Gothic Bluegrass band, too. How cool is that?) She said that Mr. Neil Gaiman would love to receive a copy and would love (as his busy schedule permits) to read it.</p>

<p>I am so stoked I can hardly type.</p>

<p>Anyway, I FedExed it to him this morning. Everyone please cross your fingers and hope that he reads it and (more importantly) likes it. If he does, that could really help me out, especially if he mentions it anywhere on his website. Regardless, though, I'm just thrilled to know that one of my favorite authors will actually have a copy of my novel on his bookshelf.</p>
