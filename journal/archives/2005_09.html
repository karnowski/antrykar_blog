<h3 class="title">A Couple of Things</h3>

<p>First off, I sent the cover for <i>Path of Darkness</i> off to the publisher today. It will be out in no more than six weeks. I'll be sure to post links to where you can find it as soon as I have them.</p>

<p>In other news, Matt Wenger has started illustrating <i>Cameron and the Grim</i>, my Young Adult story that should be out around the first of the year; maybe even sooner. The ones I've seen so far look great! I can't wait till he finishes.</p>

<p>And lastly, I watched the season premier of Smallville last night. I thought it was pretty good. I liked that the Fortress of Solitude looked very much like the one from the movies. I like that Lex has been firmly placed into the "villain" category now, but I really don't like how it ended. First off, they acted like Clark's never lost his powers before. I can't remember when it happened exactly, but I know it's happened. Plus, why can't they just let the whole Lana thing go? They've tried it and it doesn't work. Accept that. Lois is way hotter, anyway.</p>

<p>Oh well. I don't know why I brought that up; it must have just been on my mind.</p>

<p>That's about it for now. I have a full weekend of gigs and homework ahead of me.</p>

<h3 class="title">Trogdor Con</h3>

<p>Sorry this one is so short, but <a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/trogdorcon.html">this</a> is just <b>too</b> funny. If you're a fan of Strong Bad, and even if you aren't, go check <a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/trogdorcon.html">that</a> out. I think you'll dig it. I can't thank <a href="http://www.hickorywind.org">my brother</a> enough for sending this to me.</p>

<h3 class="title">New Website</h3>

<p>I've updated the website. I think it's working fine, but there could be some bugs. If anyone sees anything, please email me or post something on the forum so I can make corrections. The journal will be updated next, but I'm having trouble remembering how to bend movable type to my will, so it's going slower than I would like.</p>

<p>I uploaded the final draft of <b>Path of Darkness</b> to the publisher today. As soon as the art is finished it should only be a few more weeks (maybe as long as 6) before the book is available. I'm starting to get pretty excited.</p>

<p>If there's anyone out there dying to read it, you'll find the first chapter of <b>Path of Darkness</b> under the "excerpts" link on the main site.</p>

<h3 class="title">Have to keep this short...</h3>

<p>The battery in the laptop is about to perish.</p>

<p>I just wanted to say quickly that I got my sales statement today for Forgotten Prophecies. It seems that for the first year of its life it sold over 550 copies! I'm still in shock. I just want to thank everyone that has bought/read the book. I appreciate you all!</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
