<p>I want to thank Helen Kerslake, the reviewer, for her wonderful remarks.</p>

<h3 class="title">Splintered Magazine</h3>

<p>I've been meaning to post something about this for the past few days, but I tend to lose track of things. Sorry, I'll try to be better.</p>

<p>The all-powerful Jason Trotter and I have decided to put together an art and literary webzine. The title is <a href="http://www.splinteredmagazine.com">Splintered</a>, and we plan to include short fiction and art from all genres. The short-fiction works should be between 2,000 and 5,000 words. Both fiction and art should be submitted as electronic files to: splinteredsubmissions  AT   gmail.com.</p>

<p>Sorry about that format. I want to keep any bots from picking it up that I can, and I can't remember how to write out a mailto in html. Sad, I know.</p>

<p>Please send any submissions you can. If you know of anyone that would be interested, please jot down the email address for them. Our submission guidelines will be on the site soon, but right now there's not much of anything to look at.  I would give it a few days before I went to the site, but we need submissions as soon as possible if we want to have the first issue out in June.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<h3 class="title">Back From Merlefest</h3>

<p>Leslie and I made it back a few hours ago from spending the weekend with my dad and brother at Merlefest in Wilkesboro, NC. I got to meet a few of my brother's friends which was nice since I finally have some faces to put to the names I keep hearing. </p>

<p>Going in, I knew I wasn't even remotely what you would call a fan of bluegrass. My tastes have always leaned more toward the Celtic side of traditional music, mainly due to the overwhelming twang that pervades the majority of bluegrass. However, there were still several bands that really made the trip worth it.</p>

<p>The first, and in my mind best, was Railroad Earth. We managed to see them three times in two days, and every time was better than the last. We picked up their CD's, and they're all three so good I'm having a hard time deciding which I like best. They're a jam band in the tradition of the Grateful Dead, but not over the top and annoying like so many of those bands. Their level of musicianship is considerable, and they all possess that most elusive of abilities, taste. There wasn't any needless noodling, and their vocal harmonies were very impressive.</p>

<p>My second pick would have to be Jerry Douglass. For lack of a better phrase, he rocked. High energy, entertaining, and some really good music to boot, his set was one of my favorite of the weekend.</p>

<p>I'm starting to fall asleep, so I'm going to have to wrap this up. Some other highlights of the weekend were The Avett Brothers, who were a sort of punk-bluegrass fusion, and Sam Bush. </p>

<p>I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to cut this short. I'll try to write a little more about this in the near future, but I'm having trouble typing... It's been a long few days.</p>
