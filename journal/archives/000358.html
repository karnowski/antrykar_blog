<h3 class="title">Tests</h3>

<p>So I just finished taking my first Math test in at least seven years. I'm not real sure how I did. I feel pretty good about it, except for the very last question, which I had no clue how to solve. Luckily, it was the only multiple choice question on the test, so I guessed. Maybe I got it right, who knows?</p>

<p>All I really care about in this class is passing. Since I didn't do as well on the math portion of my ACT as I could have, I'm having to take this developmental course which doesn't affect my GPA. So, as long as I pass the thing I'll be happy.</p>

<p>I got back my first test in my OST class last night. (You know, the incredibly boring Word, Powerpoint, and Excel class.) Not surprisingly (not to seem arrogant) I got 100%. So, my combined average (including tests and homework) so far is a 100. Not too bad. Although, as easy as this class is, if I got anything less I would have been really angry with myself.</p>

<p>Anyway, that's all I have for now. Hope everything is well with everyone out there in the world. </p>

<p>Way to go son!! But as your father would say, "You only got 100%. Why not 101%? Anyway, I'm very proud of you. Oh and if the math starts to give you problems(ha) let me know. I'll hook you up with the best math teacher in Tennessee. She was able to even teach ME math. lub u </p>

<p>Gee----If I had only known you found Excel to be so easy I would have paid you to tutor Susanna last semester.  She finally passed with a D+. I have no earthly knowledge of what it is all about so I am no help.  You, of course, will excel at anything you do.  It is a Karnowski thing. I still haven't heard you play drums yet.  When Kip comes home ( this fall) we will have a together date. I am trying to think positively for them!!!</p>
