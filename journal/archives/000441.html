<h3 class="title">Melvin Goes to Dinner</h3>

<p>Leslie and I watched <a href="http://www.melvingoestodinner.com/"><u>Melvin Goes to Dinner</u></a>, directed by <a href="http://www.bobanddavid.com/">Bob Odenkirk</a> of Mr. Show, last night. We got it from Netflix and, like many of the indie films we get through them, I had no idea what to expect from this movie.  It revolves around a dinner involving four people who know each other in varying degrees. Going into too much detail about that could be considered a spoiler, and I don't like being responsible for giving those out. Let me say, though, that this film really took me by surprise. The writing (dialogue) was brilliant, and the actors were totally convincing in their roles. I really cannot recommend this film enough. There were no real "hidden truths" revealed, but there were some pretty astounding comments on human nature throughout.</p>

<p>It was a relatively short film (only abot 80 minutes long) but there are so many discoveries it seems like it's longer. But that doesn't mean its boring. Quite the opposite, in fact. I was glued to the screen wnating to know what would happen next.</p>

<p>Oh, did I mention there are some great cameos by David Cross (also from Mr. Show) and Jack Black (do I really need to tell you who he is?)? Both were hilarious, though Black's was really, really, REALLY hilarious.</p>

<p>So, if you're looking for an intelligent movie with lots of great dialogue and absolutely no explosions or gunfire, this is the way to go. I know it's available through Netflix, but I'd almost say you should just buy it. It's one of those movies that will get better the more times its viewed.</p>

<p>Also, be sure to watch the "Franks Film Festival" short in the special features. You won't be disappointed.</p>
