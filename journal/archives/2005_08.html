<h3 class="title">Interview...</h3>

<p>Sevier County Times has just posted an article about me online. It's fairly short, but you can read it <a href="http://www.seviercountynews.com/seviercountynews/default.asp?id=3&a_id=1845">here</a>, if you like.</p>

<p>And, yeah, I know. The haiku thing didn't last long at all. I'll try again soon. I promise.</p>

<h3 class="title">Music Entries</h3>

<p>In an effort to bring a little more life to <a href="http://www.citizenxensemble.com">the Citizen X website</a> I have decided to no longer post any type of music reviews or lyrics on this journal. I know, I know, what will I write about on this site now? In many ways it seems like all I talk about here is music, even though this was meant to be a place to talk about my writing and all the other things going on in my life. All I can say is that I'll try to be better about it. Things are in a constant state of crazy around here, and I have a difficult time keeping up with all of the little things that I really want to do -- like blogging. One day the planets will align and all the world will be given millions of dollars and told to go out and pursue their wildest fancy, but in the meantime, we just have to keep slogging on, taking one day at a time.</p>

<p>But, in order to help bring just a little bit of regularity to this blog without spending too much precious time, I have decided to implement a little thing I like to call "Haiku of the Day."</p>

<p>I know it's not original, but Haiku are just so much fun. I'm not going to make any promises that this will go on for any real amount of time, but I feel like experimenting and this seems like a decent little exercise. Anyway, here's your first one:</p>

<p>wet, silken petals<br />
glistening after the storm<br />
bow before the sun</p>

<p>Hey, I didn't say it was going to be <b>good</b>, did I?</p>

<p>Anyway, there's your haiku for today. Why not go to the <a href="http://s2.phpbbforfree.com/forums/index.php?mforum=anthonyrkarnows&sid=b7d8a715415b0ad36387e927b9bd69df">forum</a> and talk about it?</p>

<h3 class="title">New Forum</h3>

<p>Hello everyone. I'm in the process of updating the website. One of the new features I plan on adding is a forum. Just to see if there is actually a need for it, I've signed up with a free forum service. You can go there by <a href="http://s2.phpbbforfree.com/forums/index.php?mforum=anthonyrkarnows&sid=5dd57961f447cc0e8e85110e6041b257">clicking here</a>. If it seems like this is going to take off, I'll move to something that will allow me to get rid of the ads. Sorry about them, but they have to stay for now.</p>

<p>Well, that's all for now. Have a wonderful day...</p>
