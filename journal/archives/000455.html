<h3 class="title">This Entry isn't Worth a Title...</h3>

<p>I need to be doing some homework, but I've decided to blog a bit instead. Not that I have anything all that pressing to say, mind you, I just feel like procrastinating.</p>

<p>This week has been move at such a slow rate of speed I’m starting think that time might actually reverse and I’ll have to relive it. Wouldn’t that suck?</p>

<p>I was talking with a friend the other day about the election, a topic that’s never far from my thoughts these days. He said something that I thought was bitingly relevant. Granted, it’s not a really new concept, but it still stands up to scrutiny. The comment was something along the lines of: </p>

<p><i>It kills me how people will stand by their political party and vote for a candidate that is obviously bad for our future just because of his affiliation. It’s like the political party is their favorite football team and they feel like they have to stand by them even through the times when they keep losing.</i></p>

<p>Only the practice of voting for someone just because he’s a Republican (or a Democrat, for that matter) is ludicrous. What if Hitler came back and ran under the GOP? How many people do you think would actually vote for him just because of the damned elephant?</p>

<p>It’s frightening.</p>

<p>Shouldn't our leaders be elected based on their plans for our future and their ability to carry out those plans? Am I wrong?</p>

<p>I don't know, but like I said earlier I don’t really have anything to say… I just felt like killing some time. Have fun and go vote (early voting is underway)!!!<br />
