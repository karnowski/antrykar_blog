<h3 class="title">Superman's Song</h3>

<p>Tarzan wasn't a ladies' man<br />
He'd just come along and scoop 'em up under his arm<br />
Like that, quick as a cat in the jungle<br />
But Clark Kent, now there was a real gent<br />
He would not be caught sittin' around in no<br />
Junglescape, dumb as an ape doing nothing</p>

<p>Superman never made any money<br />
For saving the world from Solomon Grundy<br />
And sometimes I despair the world will never see<br />
Another man like him</p>

<p>Hey Bob, Supe had a straight job<br />
Even though he could have smashed through any bank<br />
In the United States, he had the strength, but he would not<br />
Folks said his family were all dead<br />
Their planet crumbled but Superman, he forced himself<br />
To carry on, forget Krypton, and keep going</p>

<p>Superman never made any money<br />
For saving the world from Solomon Grundy<br />
And sometimes I despair the world will never see<br />
Another man like him</p>

<p>Tarzan was king of the jungle and Lord over all the apes<br />
But he could hardly string together four words: "I Tarzan, You Jane."</p>

<p>Sometimes when Supe was stopping crimes<br />
I'll bet that he was tempted to just quit and turn his back<br />
On man, join Tarzan in the forest<br />
But he stayed in the city, and kept on changing clothes<br />
In dirty old phonebooths till his work was through<br />
And nothing to do but go on home</p>

<p>Superman never made any money<br />
For saving the world from Solomon Grundy<br />
And sometimes I despair the world will never see<br />
Another man like him</p>

<p>I broke this album (<i>The Ghosts That Haunt Me</i> by The Crash Test Dummies) out the other day, and have been really impressed by how good it is. I remember listening to it some with Larry back in the day, but I had never really gotten into it. This song has been standing out as one of the best on the album. It is surprisingly sad and moving. I mean, how often do you hear a - <i>truly</i> - sad song based on Superman?</p>

<p>Ben lent me that album soon after our family bought our very first CD player back in the day... it always makes me nastalgic.  We saw them in concert and witnessed a women with boobs so long the hung out the bottom hem of her shirt.  Just thought I'd commit that piece of my brain to posterity.</p>

<p>That song has been one of my favorites for years.  It kind of drifts in and out of rotation on a regular basis.  Sorry the phone call didn't work out this weekend, I'll try again next opportunity.  And yes, the picture is very artsy, you look very tortured</p>
