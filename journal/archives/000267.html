<h3 class="title">Another Day</h3>

<p>So Leslie and I went to Rooms to Go yesterday. We've been needing a new bed for a while, and it seemed like she and I had both reached the limit on how much longer we could wait. We found a really nice Simmons Queen-sized for a pretty good deal. I was pretty impressed with the place, as I had never been there before.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, while we were there Leslie started feeling sick. Yep, you guessed it: she now has what I had. It seems like she has it much worse, though. While there were certainly times when I wanted to throw-up, I never did. She, however, has not escaped that fate. </p>

<p>I feel for her. It sucks to be sick. There is nothing anyone can do to make you feel better, and you have to just be patient and let it pass. It also sucks when someone you care about is sick and you know there is nothing you can do to help.</p>

<p>I had to leave her for a little while last night while I went to talk to Wes about his movie. He was in town for his birthday, and I met him over at Jody's house. I wish I could have stayed longer, but that's life. I let him hear the four pieces Ron and I composed on Sunday night for his Zombie movie. He seemed to like them, but he did have a few suggestions.</p>

<p>I'm really looking forward to seeing the movie. For those of you who don't know, Wes Human is about to graduate from Watkins Film School in Nashville. His final project is a short zombie film titled Dead End. Ron and I are doing the music for it, and I got to play a zombie. It was awesome. Now that I've played a zombie in a movie, I can now mark off one of the things on my list to do before I die.</p>

<p>And that, as they say, is about all I have for now.</p>
