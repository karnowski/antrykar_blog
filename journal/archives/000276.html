<h3 class="title">New Article</h3>

<p>Hey everyone! Sorry I haven't written anything in a while, but I've been busy at work and too tired when I got home to put anything up. I wanted to share with everyone, though, that I just sold another (this makes the third) article to a political website called Strike-the-Root.com. It's a pretty short piece, as I'm pretty short-winded at times. you can check it out here:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.strike-the-root.com/4/karnowski/karnowski1.html">http://www.strike-the-root.com/4/karnowski/karnowski1.html</a><br />
<em>[Editors note: I made the address a hyperlink for you, Tony -- Larry 03/25/04 1:26PM]</em></p>

<p>I don't remember how to do a hyperlink in HTML, so you'll have to copy and paste if you want to read it. Do you still have that book I lent you, Frank? I may need to borrow it back soon so I can remember how to do it, unless someone wants to just tell me here.</p>

<p>Anyway, things are good. Leslie and I gt our new bed last Friday, and let me tell you, it is awesome. Best sleep I've had in over a year, easily.</p>

<p>Our new puppy, Petra (no, I did not name her after that horrible 80's Christian band), is doing very well. She and Ender have become good friends, and the two of them are doing well. She's pretty much house-broken now (I'm amazed... it didn't take as long as I thought it would) although we have to kennel her when we aren't home or she does very bad things like get into Leslie's meds. She didn't eat any, though, thank God.</p>

<p>Anyway, I guess that about wraps it up for now... Let me know what you all think of that article if you read it. You can post opinions here or on that site, or both... Whichever you prefer...</p>

<p>I personally like the approach of Israel's PM Ariel Sharon. Seems a true believe in the age old code of Hammurabi. I found it rather amusing that the world leaders including our own condemned him for finally and rightly killing the father of Hamas. As Sharon stated how can we comdemn him for killing a man who directly caused the shed of so much Israeli blood when we ourselves are involved in a global war on terror. As far as being able to add to your keen observations well I would like to but I cannot. My oath and honor prevent me from it, especially in such a forum. </p>

<p>I will state the I am opposed to the stripping of rights laid down in the patriot act. <br />
I can't help but think of Jack Nicholson's line in the movie "A Few Good Men" "You can't handle the truth" now there's a campaign slogan with truth. </p>

<p>I thought the article was great. of course I may be prejudice. but I don't think I am. Keep up the good work. And redo your blog more often!</p>

<p>Irony can be so tricky to define... but it strikes me as ironic that the title I see when I click over every day is "New Article," but no new blog entry.  You are taunting us, no?</p>

<p>I'll admit, Val, I'm a little confused. There IS a new entry under "New Article." I don't know... maybe I just misunderstood your comment...</p>

<p>Thanks, Mom. I think you are allowed to be prejudiced.</p>

<p>I think, though, that I may refrain from any future articles like this, though. The first two I sold didn't garner any kind of response, but this one has caused by inbox to be flooded with some (occasionally) questionable messages. One was trying to et me to enroll in what I took to be some kind of new age/fundamentalist/leftist cult.</p>

<p>Scary.</p>
