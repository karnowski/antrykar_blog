<p>Well, October is almost on us, which means Halloween isn't too far away. And, because of this, I decided to start the season a little early by breaking out this tune. As is true of most of <a href="http://www.selfmusic.net">Matt Mahafey's</a> lyrics, these aren't quite the same without the melody and music behind them, but they still crack me up. If you haven't by now, you should follow that little link to <a href="http://www.selfmusic.net">Matt's website</a> and listen to some of the B-Sides from Self's as-yet-unreleased album, <i>Ornament and Crime</i>, which I am anxiously awaiting.</p>

<p>Anyway, the song above, KiDdIeS, can be found on the album <i>Half-Baked Serenades</i>. It may be a little hard to come by these days, but I would say a copy could be found on <a href="http://www.half.com">Half.com</a> or some other, simliar site. It's worth it, and I promise you won't be disappointed by it!!!</p>

<p>In keeping with the Halloween spirit, might I suggest a lovely little novel by Stuart O'Nan entitled "The Night Country". Highly entertaining, excellently written, and short enough to be able to cram into all those short bouts between everything else you have to do each day. Contraindicated if you dislike stories written in the first person present tense.</p>

<p>I feel that there's going to be a lot going on for me this Hallows, if you catch my drift. See my livejournal (linked above) for more details.</p>

<p>Hope all's well with you, Tony.</p>
