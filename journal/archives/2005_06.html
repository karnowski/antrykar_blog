<h3 class="title">AdventureCon 2005</h3>

<p>I just got in from the last day of AdventureCon 2005. It was great! I met a lot of really interesting people, and actually sold several books as well. Despite having tried, I never made it to any of the previous AdventureCons, so I didn't realy know what to expect. I was very pleasantly surprised. The convention space was huge, and there were more people than I would have imagined at the Con yesterday. Today was pretty busy, too, but nothing compared to yesterday. I have a few new links I need to add to my links page--in addition to the ones from ConCarolinas as well--I swear I'll get to that this week.</p>

<p>In other news, the first of three ads to appear in Dragon Magazine is due to come out this week. I think the new issue hits the shelves on the 22nd. Please look out for it!</p>

<p>That's about it for now. I'll report more as soon as I have more news.</p>

<h3 class="title">Too Much For One Title</h3>

<p>It's been a fairly eventful few weeks. Last Wednesday was the launch date for the first issue of <a href="http://www.splinteredmagazine.com">Splintered</a>. We had some really good submissions, so please go check out the site. Your comments and suggestions will be very welcome if you wish to share them.</p>

<p>On top of this, I had my first appearence at a Con last weekend. Leslie and I travelled to Charlotte, NC to attend ConCarolinas. I can honestly say I haven't had that much fun in longer than I can remember. We met some great people and I can't wait for the next one! Some of the highights of the Con were meeting Bill Blair from Babylon 5 and Ken Foree from the original <u>Dawn of the Dead</u>. But the reason we had so much fun was that we hooked up with Rich Sigfrit of <a href="http://www.requiemoftheoutcast.com">Requiem of the Outcast</a>, Earl Newton of <a href="http://www.southernronin.com">Southern Ronin Productions</a>, and <a href="http://www.shaunorourke.com">Shaun O'Rourke</a>. I met them at the Less than $20 Film Festival (which was a freakin' blast). I had entered "The Quiet Ones," the short film Ron and I have been working for close to (if not longer than) a year. It went over very well. Everyone laughed in the right places, which is always a good sign. Anyway, I hooked up with them (and a very nice girl named Melissa that was very accomodating when it came to alcohol), went out for barbeque, and just had a generally great time.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.citizenxensemble.com">Citizen X</a> is finishing up the final touches on our next album, Songs from Dead End. It should be available at <a href="http://www.cdbaby.com">CdBaby.com</a> within the next two months. I'll let you know for sure as soon as I know.</p>

<p>And last but not least, I will be at the <a href="http://www.adventurecon.com">Adventure Con</a> the weekend after this coming one. It looks like it's going to be pretty fun, and there are quite a few celebrities this year. Check out them out!</p>

<p>Anyway, I think that's all for now. If I think of anything else, I'll be sure to add it here.</p>
