<h3 class="title">She Still Loves Him</h3>

<p>He writes her a letter<br />
Tells her he won't be lonesome - she still loves him<br />
He lost his temper<br />
And belted his love 'cross the room - she still loves him</p>

<p>Drinks when he's sad<br />
Gets happy then mad at the world - she still loves him<br />
Never remembers<br />
That day in September when wed - she still loves him</p>

<p>So she recalls the days when they were younger<br />
Flowers could heal her wounds<br />
But now those days are long since gone forever<br />
Now her pain just fills every room</p>

<p>Faces aglow<br />
As the light from the T.V. show just separates them now - she still loves him<br />
All they wanted to be<br />
Was as happy as couple #3 on their favorite game show - she still loves him</p>

<p>He recalls the days when they were younger<br />
The future could heal their wounds<br />
But now those days are long since gone forever<br />
Now her pain just fills every room</p>

<p>I know someday this will all work out<br />
She'll never face this alone<br />
The light in her eyes may be flickering dim<br />
But she still loves him</p>

<p>This song was written by Andrew Sturmer for the Jellyfish, quite possibly the world's most under-rated band ever. The song appears on <u>Bellybutton</u>, their first album, which was released in 1990. The album sold well, had a few hits on the college charts, and they were expected to go on to do great things. Their second album, <u>Spilt Milk</u>, is unbelievable. It is a masterpiece that never got the recognition it deserves because the record label didn't put enough into the marketing. Because of this lack of label support, the album didn't sale well, and I'll never get to have a new Jellyfish album to listen to.</p>

<p>It's a travesty.</p>
