<h3 class="title">Good God, make it end...</h3>

<p>I don't know if any of you are aware of this or not, but I <i>really</i> hate my job. </p>

<p>Well, actually, it isn't the job so much as the company. I won't name names here, just in case someone in a position of power at my place of employment happens to come across this page, but those of you who know me know where I work. People tell me that you're going to run into B.S. politics in any job, and I accept that as truth, but dammit that doesn't mean I can't get fed up and complain about it.</p>

<p>Well, in all honesty, I'm pretty much <i>always</i> fed up with my job.</p>

<p>The worst is when someone you work with and consider a friend finally breaks free and finds another job. Not only are you robbed of one of the few things that make the day bearable, but you also have to wonder how they actually made it happen. What ancient rite did they perform that gave them the power to escape? How do I get out? Is there even a place I can go from here?</p>

<p>We wake up every morning, go to jobs that we hate, just so we can barely manage to scrape by on our bills. We're bombarded by movies, radio, and television programming that tries to make us believe that unless we have millions of dollars, a really cool car, and a house that could shelter a hundred people comfortably we aren't successful.</p>

<p>Pardon me for saying so, but f--k that. I'm ready to break out of this B.S. and move into a life I feel I have more control over. I'm sick of worrying about what stupid changes are going to be made to my job that will increase my level of discomfort. I swear, sometimes I feel like the only purpose of corporations is to see exactly how much crap a single person (or group of persons) can take before they crack.</p>

<p>The song "Someone Keeps Moving My Chair" by They Might Be Giants always makes me think of this concept. I don't know why, but this passage in particular does it:</p>

<p>"Would you mind if we balance this glass of milk<br />
Where your visiting friend accidentally was killed?<br />
Would it be okay with you if we wrote a reminder<br />
Of things we'll forget to do today otherwise,<br />
Using a green magic marker, if it's alright<br />
On the back of your head?"</p>

<p>Mr. Horrible<br />
Mr. Horrible<br />
We're not done with you yet Mr. Horrible<br />
You have to try on these pants so the Ugliness Men<br />
Can decide if they're just as embarrassing as we think<br />
We have to be sure about this</p>

<p>But Mr. Horrible says, "I don't mind<br />
The thing that bothers me is<br />
Someone keeps moving my chair"</p>

<p>Someone keeps moving my chair<br />
<a href="http://www.lyricsdepot.com/they-might-be-giants/someone-keeps-moving-my-chair.html">source</a> of the lyrics</p>

<p><br />
So, in the words of the late, great Freddie Mercury (although I'm pretty sure this isn't how he meant them to be used): "I want to break free."</p>

<p>But how?</p>
