<h3 class="title">Because I love my Mother...</h3>

<p>I don't really have too much to report as of now, but because I love my mother I will post something anyway.</p>

<p>So far, I'm still working out, and I can already tell a bit of a difference. Not really in physical appearance, but just in the way I feel. I don't ache quite as much as I did, and I don't get sore to the point that I want someone to rip my arms off anymore. It's all going pretty well for now, so I'm hoping I won't screw it up and quit. Just have to keep thoughts like that out of my head.</p>

<p>Still haven't smoked. I think today is day twelve. It is, however, only day five with no nicotine at all. The first seven days were conquered with the aid of the Nicoderm patch. I've actually contemplated the possibility of just wearing the patch forever. After all, it isn't the <i>nicotine</i> that's the problem, just the carbon monoxide and tar. Although, I'd rather not be dependant on a patch either.</p>

<p>Let's see... not much else has happened. I submitted a short story to the Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction called 'Ahnk of the Immortals.' They turned it down. I was much more disappointed than I thouht I would be, even considering I really didn't expect them to accept it. Oh well...</p>

<p>Well that's it. I'm thinking about posting that story here, but it's pretty long. It's just under 10,000 words, which is about the equivalent of 32 double-spaced pages.</p>

<p>Actually, if you want to check it out, you can go <a href="http://www.fanstory.com/displaystory.jsp?id=22057">here</a>. I know it has a different title, but it's the same story. I had to change it for Fanstory because I had posted a <i>much</i> earlier version under the title 'Ahnk of the Immortals.' So anyway... read it, review it, whatever...</p>
